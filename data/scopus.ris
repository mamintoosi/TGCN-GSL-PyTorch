AB  - In this paper, we present the main results from the Second ATS-Level Assessment of the Clean Sky 2 Technology Evaluator. We first present the models employed and then move to the passenger and fleet forecast results up to 2050. Based upon these traffic forecasts, we show the environmental effect of Clean Sky 2 technology in terms of CO2 emissions. The main benefit of the forecast method employed is its high resolution in terms of each flight route between airports being modelled. Consequently, we can consider effects such as airport capacity constraints which will have a substantial impact on future passenger volume and fleet development. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting significantly impacts the development of smart cities. Owing to uneven development levels and the substantial costs of data collection, many cities often encounter the challenge of limited data availability when undertaking traffic prediction tasks. This paper introduces Transfer-Mamba, a method that employs Spatio-temporal selective state space models with transfer learning for few-shot traffic prediction across multiple cities. Transfer-Mamba features a Spatio-temporal graph pre-training process, which incorporates an encoder–decoder architecture with a Mamba module and an adaptive graph convolutional network. This process enhances the feature representation and transferability of traffic data from multiple source cities by capturing Spatio-temporal correlations. To distinguish unique traffic patterns and data distributions in source cities, an unsupervised learning algorithm groups similar traffic characteristics during the Spatio-temporal knowledge clustering phase. These clustered patterns are then retrieved through a Spatio-temporal knowledge querying process, which extracts traffic meta-knowledge to guide the few-shot prediction phase for the target city. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that Transfer-Mamba outperforms the existing mainstream baselines, which provides valuable insight for optimizing road traffic management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The field of traffic forecasting has been the subject of considerable attention as a critical component in alleviating traffic congestion and improving urban services. Given the regular patterns of human activities, it is evident that traffic flow is inherently periodic. However, most of existing studies restrict themselves to recent historical observations and typically yield structurally and computationally complex models, which greatly limits the forecasting accuracy and hinders the application of models in realistic situations. To this end, this paper proposes a concise framework named Spatial-Temporal Gated Multi-Layer Perceptron (ST-GMLP), aiming to enhance the forecasting performance by leveraging the temporal patterns of different scales with a simple and effective structure. Nevertheless, due to the incorporation of more historical features, the presence of distribution shifts between periods further restricts the forecasting accuracy. To address the above issue, ST-GMLP employs a parallel structure of learning the interdependencies of traffic flow in both spatial node and temporal directions, and then establishes the interactions between time and space to effectively mitigate the adverse effects due to temporal distribution shifts. Owing to the utilization of MLP with gated mechanisms (GMLP) for modeling the spatial-temporal interdependencies, ST-GMLP has significant advantages in terms of training efficiency and resources occupation. Extensive experimental findings indicate that ST-GMLP exhibits superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Companies providing telecommunication services, especially in Beyond 5G networks, are increasingly interested in traffic forecasting to improve the services provided to their users. However, forecasting network traffic is challenging due to traffic data's dynamic and non-stationary nature. This study proposes an effective deep learning-based traffic prediction technique using BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory). The proposed method begins with preprocessing using K-SVD (K-means Singular Value Decomposition) to reduce dimensionality and enhance data representation. Next, sparse feature ex-traction is performed using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and a sparse matrix is constructed. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the sparse matrix, which effectively selects the most significant features for prediction. The optimized sparse matrix is fed into the BiLSTM model for accurate traffic fore-casting. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) while achieving higher accuracy (ACC) compared to traditional neural networks. The results demonstrate that the proposed sparse matrix, integrated with BiLSTM, provides superior prediction accuracy and better generalization, making it a robust solution for network traffic forecasting in Beyond 5G networks. © 2025, Qubahan.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is essential for applications such as route planning and vehicle communication. However, dynamic traffic patterns, diverse spatial-temporal dependencies, and external factors pose significant challenges. Existing methods often model temporal, spatial, and external factors separately, failing to capture their joint effects across different spatial-temporal scales and external influences. To address these, we propose uTransformer, a unified transformer model that captures joint spatial-temporal dependencies and integrates external factors like weather and holidays. Unlike existing models, uTransformer constructs a three-dimensional spatial-temporal correlation map (STC-MAP) to model spatial-temporal interactions across various time scales, effectively capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, it features a scalable encoding scheme that flexibly incorporates multiple types and quantities of external factors. Experimental results on NYC-BIKE and NYC-TAXI datasets show uTransformer achieves high accuracy, with RMSE improved by 10.97% and MAPE by 16.06%, outperforming baseline models and enhancing prediction reliability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - This study explores the integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to enhance traffic management in smart cities. The primary objective was to develop a predictive model that improves traffic forecasting accuracy, reduces congestion, and optimizes real-time traffic management. The methodology involved combining CNNs' powerful spatial feature extraction capabilities with PSO's optimization strengths. Traffic data collected from IoT sensors were processed to extract relevant spatial features using CNNs, and PSO was employed to fine-tune the CNN hyperparameters and feature selection. Key findings indicate that the CNN-PSO model significantly improves traffic prediction accuracy, with an average increase from 76.5% to 92.0% across various urban areas. The model demonstrated a 20.0% reduction in average traffic delay and a 25.0% enhancement in traffic flow efficiency. Real-time metrics revealed high prediction accuracy and low processing times, indicating the model's effectiveness in timely traffic forecasting. These results underscore the model's potential for optimizing traffic management systems, reducing congestion, and improving urban mobility. The implications for smart city development are substantial, as the model offers a robust solution for managing complex traffic patterns and enhancing real-time decision-making. The study suggests that integrating advanced machine learning techniques like CNNs and PSO can lead to more efficient and adaptive traffic management solutions, contributing to the development of smarter, more resilient urban environments. Future research could expand on these findings by incorporating additional data sources and testing the model's scalability and real-world applicability.  © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Regional traffic forecasting is a critical challenge in urban mobility, with applications to various fields such as the Internet of Everything. In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims to expand upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions and the populations that traverse them to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavor is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture for regional traffic forecasting referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the aforementioned information is included via two novel dedicated algorithms, the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution significantly outperforms its competitors in an experimental evaluation of 19 forecasting models across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each component of the proposed solution enhances its overall performance. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in effective traffic management. In recent years, numerous researchers have employed spatiotemporal graph neural networks to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of traffic flow and have achieved better predictive performance. However, the accuracy of these models decreases rapidly with increasing number of prediction steps, which makes them less effective for long-sequence time forecasting. Recently, Mamba has attracted attention owing to its ability to handle complex dependencies in sequences while maintaining near-linear complexity. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, this study proposes a traffic forecasting model that integrates Mamba with a graph convolutional network. The proposed model extracts spatial relationships between road network nodes using a graph convolutional network and captures long-term temporal dependencies in historical traffic data using a bidirectional Mamba architecture. Specifically, spatial features are extracted using Chebyshev convolution, followed by feature encoding and embedding. These embeddings are processed by a bidirectional Mamba encoder to generate outputs that are combined with residual connections obtained via residual convolution. Finally, projection and dimensional transformation complete the feature extraction and fusion processes. The accuracy of the proposed model was better than that of the baseline models, as evidenced by the experimental results obtained on the four real-world datasets.

AB  - Deep learning models are widely used in traffic forecasting and have achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. However, their black-box nature presents challenges for interpretability and usability, particularly when predictions are significantly influenced by complex urban contextual features. This study aims to leverage an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) approach, counterfactual explanations, to enhance the explainability of deep learning-based traffic forecasting models and elucidate their relationships with various contextual features. We present a comprehensive framework that generates counterfactual explanations for traffic forecasting. The study first implements a graph convolutional network (GCN) to predict traffic speed based on historical traffic data and contextual variables. Counterfactual explanations are generated through a multi-objective optimization process, with four objectives, validity, proximity, sparsity, and plausibility, each emphasizing different aspects of optimization. We investigated the impact of contextual features on traffic speed prediction under varying spatial and temporal conditions. The scenario-driven counterfactual explanations integrate two types of user-defined constraints, directional and weighting constraints, to tailor the search for counterfactual explanations to specific use cases. These tailored explanations benefit machine learning practitioners who aim to understand the model's learning mechanisms and traffic domain experts who seek insights for necessity factors to alter traffic condition. The results showcase the effectiveness of counterfactual explanations in revealing traffic patterns learned by deep learning models and explaining the relationship between traffic prediction and contextual features, demonstrating its potential for interpreting black-box deep learning models. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - In recent years, the application of graph neural networks (GNN) in multivariate time series forecasting has yielded remarkable achievements. The adjacency matrix which describes the interactions among variables is dense and static in most previous efforts no matter hand-crafted or self-learned. However, we argue that: (1) In the real-world scenario, the interactions could be dynamic and evolving; (2) A sparse and compact graph structure could better reflect such interactions. Along this line, this paper proposes a deep neural network based on GNN to address multivariate time series forecasting problem. Firstly, we construct a sparse and principal structure from the original dense graph structure differentiably by Gumbel-Softmax. Secondly, a new series of graphs are constructed by the recurrent neural network to model the evolving correlations among variables during each individual time point. Thirdly, a novel temporal constraint which is aimed at enhancing the training process is proposed to help evolving graphs capture the temporal smoothness of time series. Lastly, a unified neural network is constructed that integrates all of the above modules to make the final prediction, effectively addressing both temporal dependency and pairwise correlations in a comprehensive manner. Experiments are performed on six datasets comprising various domains, evaluating the performance of our model in single-step and multi-step forecasting tasks. The results showcase the exceptional performance of our model compared to the existing approaches in the field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the inherent complexity of urban road networks and the irregular periodic fluctuations of traffic flow, traffic forecasting remains a challenging spatiotemporal modeling task.Existing studies predominantly focus on capturing spatial dependencies among nodes, while often overlooking the long-term evolutionary patterns and internally stable, recurring flow behaviors at individual nodes. This limitation compromises both the generalization capacity and long-term forecasting performance of current models.To address these issues, we propose a novel Dynamic Pattern Matching Network (DPMNet) that incorporates a memory-augmented architecture to dynamically learn and retrieve historical traffic patterns at each node, thereby enabling efficient modeling of localized flow dynamics. Building upon this foundation, we further develop a comprehensive framework named DPMformer, which integrates daily and weekly temporal embeddings to enhance the modeling of long-term trends and leverages a pattern matching mechanism to improve the representation of complex spatiotemporal structures.Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms mainstream baseline models across multiple forecasting horizons and evaluation metrics. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting predicts future traffic condition based on historical traffic data and facilitates important applications such as travel planning and traffic control. In this paper, we propose an effective traffic forecasting method dubbed patch-based graph convolutional recurrent network (i.e., PGCRN). In particular, PGCRN organizes multiple data points that are consecutive in time as a patch and uses patch as the basic input and output unit. Compared with using individual data point as the basic unit as in existing work, patch better captures local temporal correlation, controls error accumulation in RNN by reducing sequence length, and accelerates execution. PGCRN adopts an encoder-decoder architecture with the graph convolutional recurrent cell (GCRCell) at its core to extract spatial-temporal information. We train embedding representations for the patches by jointly considering two objectives, i.e., self-supervised learning encourages similar patches to have similar representations, and time-aware graph learning dynamically adjusts the correlation graph between locations over time to model their spatial dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets and compare PGCRN with 11 state-of-the-art traffic forecasting methods. The results show that PGCRN consistently outperforms all baselines in the accuracy of the predictions and suggest that our designs are effective. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is the foundation of the intelligent transportation system (ITS). Among existing methods, researchers utilize deep neural networks to capture spatial–temporal correlations. While state-of-the-art methods have shown remarkable progress, they still have some limitations: (i) Most existing models struggle to make accurate prediction performance over longer time horizons due to the challenge of modeling heterogeneous temporal patterns. (ii) Recent studies still lack the ability to model the dynamic road network structure in a specific spatial–temporal context. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel hybrid spatial–temporal graph neural network (HSTGNN) for traffic forecasting. In the temporal dimension, we design a decoupling layer to reveal the heterogeneous traffic patterns using frequency domain analysis. Moreover, we propose a dual-channel learner to capture complementary information from heterogeneous features, which enhances the model's capacity to handle complex temporal dynamics, facilitating long-term traffic forecasting tasks. In the spatial dimension, considering the road networks’ inherent attributes and time-varying spatial structures, HSTGNN employs a novel hybrid graph learning approach to learn compound spatial correlations. This approach ensures that the model captures the comprehensive spatial correlations from both macro and micro perspectives. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on six real-world traffic datasets, covering different traffic scenarios, to demonstrate the effectiveness of HSTGNN over state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - In recent years, more and more scholars have applied graph neural networks in combination with other modules to the field of traffic flow forecasting and achieved outstanding results. Most of these graph-based methods describe pairwise relationships between two objects, but in real transportation networks, the relationships between objects are often of a high order. To effectively learn the higher-order relationships between objects, this paper proposes a dynamic spatio-temporal residual hypergraph convolutional network for traffic forecasting (Res-DSTHGCN). In this paper, we combine dynamic spatio-temporal graph convolution and dynamic spatio-temporal residual hypergraph convolution to capture more global spatio-temporal features than models with only spatio-temporal graph convolution or only spatio-temporal hypergraph convolution. Meanwhile, the hypergraph convolutional network enhanced by residual connectivity improves the oversmoothing problem that may occur in the traditional hypergraph convolutional network (HGCN) along with the continuous stacking of layers. It is proved that the prediction accuracy of the method proposed in this paper is improved by conducting experiments for comparison with other baselines. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - The rapid growth of computer networks has led to designing a more flexible and efficient architecture called Software-Defined Networking (SDN). SDN decouples the control plane from the physical networking devices in the data plane. SDN’s global perspective and programmability have inspired researchers to develop ideas that would have been difficult or even impossible in traditional networks. Traffic forecasting is an interesting area that has driven the efforts of this paper. In this study, an optimization of time series parameters is performed to achieve the most suitable time series structure for feeding deep-learning algorithms. Popular deep-learning algorithms, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are compared in traffic forecasting. An improved version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), called Local Optimum Escape Particle Swarm Optimization (LOEPSO), is proposed. The algorithm is a variation of PSO inspired by Harmony Search optimization to replace the global worst particle with a randomly created particle. A Ryu controller has been customized to gather the network’s switches’ port statistics and generate a time series from traffic passing through the ports. A traffic generator application, implemented as a Python thread, runs at the SDN network’s hosts simulated in Mininet. For an extensive analysis, traffic is generated in two modes: an idle mode with regular traffic and the worst-case scenario where a chaotic function is used to determine traffic volume. The results show that CNN and LSTM provide reliable forecasting for regular traffic. However, despite having equivalent training results in chaotic traffic, LSTM performs better in forecasting validation data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is of vital importance to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, current methods often neglect the complex spatiotemporal relationships and environmental factors, thereby limiting the forecasting accuracy. In this study, urban roads are regarded as a complex system, and a traffic flow forecasting model based on a dual-state network of urban traffic factors is proposed, integrating traffic domain knowledge with data-driven approaches. A physical-virtual road network structure is constructed to capture spatiotemporal correlations, and clustering algorithms are employed to classify the dual traffic states. The model segments historical data into time intervals according to the macro and micro states and utilizes a multi-relational graph attention mechanism to learn the embeddings of the network topology. Evaluations based on real-world data demonstrate that the performance of this model is superior to that of traditional models. © 2025 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

AB  - High-quality traffic forecasting is critical to facilitating urban intelligent transformation. In deep learning enabled urban intelligence era, accurate traffic forecasting requires large-scale data, obtaining which is not always feasible because of limitations posed by scarce equipment resources in cross-city scenarios. To address this problem, existing methods propose to learn transferable meta-knowledge from rich source city data so as to guide the forecasting on the target city. However, they mainly focus on obtaining a source distribution-centric or source and target shared knowledge, rather than target distribution-centric transferable knowledge, which results in unavoidable disturbances due to migration noise. In this case, we propose a cross-city transfer learning method based on Incremental Distribution Rectification from the perspectives of distribution discrepancy quantification and calibration, called Cross-IDR. Specifically, we leverage the Koopman enabled Optimal Transport method to measure the transfer process between distributions, thus modifying the source distribution-centric meta-knowledge to be target distribution-centric. In addition, a Spatio-Temporal Interaction alignment method is proposed to enhance the mining of cross-city interactions between spatial and temporal information. We verify the effectiveness of Cross-IDR on real-world traffic datasets, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Multivariate time series forecasting has extensive applications in urban computing, such as financial analysis, weather prediction, and traffic forecasting. Using graph structures to model the complex correlations among variables in time series, and leveraging graph neural networks and recurrent neural networks for temporal aggregation and spatial propagation stage, has shown promise. However, traditional methods' graph structure node learning and discrete neural architecture are not sensitive to issues such as sudden changes, time variance, and irregular sampling often found in real-world data. To address these challenges, we propose a method called Adaptive Graph structure Learning neural Rough Differential Equations (AGLRDE). Specifically, we combine dynamic and static graph structure learning to adaptively generate a more robust graph representation. Then we employ a spatio-temporal encoderdecoder based on Neural Rough Differential Equations (Neural RDE) to model spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a path reconstruction loss to constrain the path generation stage. We conduct experiments on six benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The results show that AGLRDE effectively handles aforementioned challenges, significantly improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This study presents the development of AST-Deep, an attention-based deep learning model aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of short-term traffic flow forecasting. Traffic forecasting plays a critical role in managing road operations, reducing congestion, enhancing safety, and optimizing transportation resources. The AST-Deep model consists of three key steps: (1) Spatial Correlation Analysis, where an enhanced version of ResNet is utilized to capture spatial dependencies between mileposts; (2) Temporal Correlation Modeling, where an attention-driven LSTM network is employed to model the temporal dynamics of traffic flow; and (3) Weighted Feature Fusion, which integrates the spatial and temporal features to generate the final traffic flow predictions. The model incorporates three traffic flow patterns-real-time, daily, and weekly-allowing it to account for periodic traffic behavior and improve forecasting precision. Experiments conducted on real-world traffic datasets show that AST-Deep consistently outperforms nine baseline models, including traditional and machine learning approaches, by a significant margin in terms of forecasting accuracy. Specifically, the AST-Deep model achieves a 1 to 5 % improvement in mean absolute error and root mean square error over the best-performing baseline model as the prediction horizon increases. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AST-Deep in capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies to provide more accurate and reliable short-term traffic flow predictions. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden 2025.

AB  - Transportation Cyber-Physical System (T-CPS) is a pivotal technology for advancing Intelligent Transportation System, integrating physical transportation infrastructure with network technology and computational algorithms. This integration facilitates real-time road condition monitoring, accurate traffic forecasting, and efficient traffic management to reduce congestion and enhance safety. However, relying on public channels for data transmission in T-CPS exposes it to numerous security threats. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an intelligence blockchain-based lightweight authentication protocol to enhance the security and trustworthiness of Intelligent Transportation System. The protocol is designed to resist common attacks, such as capture attacks and insider privileged personnel attacks, ensuring secure vehicle communication. Through rigorous Real-Or-Random model formal proofs, the security properties of the protocol are validated. Furthermore, the efficiency of the protocol is demonstrated, showing its lightweight nature and security robustness. This work represents a significant step toward secure, reliable, and efficient communication in vehicular networks, paving the way for more robust T-CPS applications, including autonomous driving and real-time traffic management.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic prediction is essential for transportation planning, resource allocation, congestion management and enhancing travel experiences. This study optimizes data preprocessing techniques to improve machine learning-based traffic prediction models. Data preprocessing is critical in preparing the data for machine learning models. This study proposes an approach that optimizes data preprocessing techniques, focusing on flow-based analysis and optimization, to enhance traffic prediction models. The proposed approach explores fixed and variable orders of data preprocessing using a genetic algorithm across five diverse datasets. Evaluation metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared error assess model performance. The results indicate that the genetic algorithm's variable order achieves the best performance for the ArcGIS Hub and Frementon Bridge Cycle datasets, fixed order one preprocessing for the Traffic Prediction dataset and variable order using the genetic algorithm for the PeMS08 dataset. Fixed order 2 preprocessing yields the best performance for the XI AN Traffic dataset. These findings highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate data preprocessing flow order for each dataset, improving traffic prediction accuracy and reliability. The proposed approach advances traffic prediction methodologies, enabling more precise and reliable traffic forecasts for transportation planning and management applications.  © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Communication traffic prediction is of great guiding significance for communication planning management and improvement of communication service quality. However, due to the complex spatiotemporal correlation and uncertainty caused by the spatial topology and dynamic time characteristics of mobile communication networks, traffic prediction is facing enormous challenges. We propose a mobile traffic prediction method using dynamic spatiotemporal synchronous graph convolutional network (DSSGCN). DSSGCN has designed multiple components, which can effectively capture the heterogeneity in the local space-time map. More specifically, the network not only models the dynamic characteristics of nodes in the spatiotemporal graph of network traffic, but also captures the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics of the edges of mobile service data with different time stamps. The outputs of these two components are fused by collaborative convolution to obtain the prediction results. Experiments on two ground truth mobile traffic datasets show that our DSSGCN model has good prediction performance. © 2025 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - Personal GPS trajectory is essential for businesses and emerging data markets due to its relevance in various data-driven methods, including traffic forecasting, accident prediction, and profiling driving behavior. Watermarking is a method that facilitates verification of data ownership and authenticity by embedding provenance information into the data. Whereas watermarking is commonly adopted in the image and audio domains, only a few initial watermarking methods exist for GPS trajectory data. GPS trajectory watermarking is particularly challenging due to the spatio-Temporal data properties and easiness of data modification. As a result, existing watermarking methods often embed only minimal provenance information, lack robustness, and can fail to preserve data utility for downstream applications. In this work, we propose W-Trace-a novel, effective, robust, and utility-preserving GPS trajectory watermarking method. W-Trace transforms a GPS trajectory into a complex domain and applies the Fourier transformation to decompose the trajectory into the frequency representation. W-Trace embeds watermarks in the frequency representation and verifies them in a spatiotemporally-Aware procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and utility of the proposed W-Trace approach in realistic settings using real-world GPS trajectory datasets. In contrast to the baselines, the proposed W-Trace approach is robust to a wide range of trajectory modifications while preserving the GPS trajectory characteristics required for the downstream applications.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Accurate prediction of traffic flow is fundamental to building intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing research methods fail to fully account for the potential spatiotemporal correlations, heterogeneity, and time delays present in traffic flow data. In addressing these concerns, this work introduces a novel Spatio-Temporal Fusion Delay Graph Convolutional Network (STFDGCN) model. The STFDGCN model features a Spatio-Temporal Delay Graph Convolution Module (STDGCM) that simulates time delays in traffic flow through displacement operations following local graph convolutions, and captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity by employing multiple STDGCMs. The inclusion of a self-attention mechanism allows the model to effectively capture global spatiotemporal correlations. Additionally, the model incorporates an Information Fusion Module (IFM) that integrates local information with global information captured by the self-attention mechanism, offering a more comprehensive analysis. Finally, the model’s comprehensive capability is further improved by stacking multiple STFDGCL layers. Extensive tests on three real-world datasets validate the usefulness of the proposed STFDGCN model by demonstrating its superior prediction accuracy compared to other baselines, highlighting the model’s robustness and its potential to enhance traffic flow forecasting in various practical scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for smart city development. However, existing spatiotemporal modeling methods often face significant challenges, including limitations in handling complex temporal dependencies, capturing multiscale spatial relationships, and modeling the interaction between temporal and spatial features. These challenges arise due to the reliance on extended historical data, fixed adjacency matrices, and the lack of dynamic spatiotemporal interaction modeling. To address these issues, we propose the Spatiotemporal Dual-Scale Interaction Network (SDSINet). SDSINet introduces an implicit temporal information enhancement method that embeds temporal identity information into feature representations, reducing the computational overhead and improving the modeling of global temporal features. Additionally, SDSINet integrates a dynamic multiscale spatial modeling approach that combines adaptive and scale-specific graphs, enabling the model to capture both local and global spatial dependencies. Furthermore, SDSINet incorporates a dual-scale spatiotemporal interaction learning framework that captures short-term and long-term temporal dependencies as well as multiscale spatial correlations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets – traffic flow (PeMS04), speed (PeMSD7(M)), and demand (NYCBike Drop-off/Pick-up) – demonstrate that SDSINet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, SDSINet achieves a 14.03% reduction in MAE on the NYCBike Drop-off dataset compared to AFDGCN, setting a new benchmark for traffic forecasting. © 2025

AB  - Short-term traffic forecasting is an important part of intelligent transportation systems. Accurately predicting short-term traffic trends can avoid traffic congestion and plan travel routes, which is of great significance to urban management and traffic scheduling. The difficulty of short-term urban traffic forecasting is that the traffic flow is random and will be dynamically changed by the traffic conditions of nearby nodes. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a model based on Dynamic Diffusion Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network. It first combines the dynamic generation matrix and the static distance matrix to grasp real-time traffic conditions, and then introduces the diffusion random walk strategy to capture the correlation of spatial nodes. Finally, the convolutional LSTM module is used to mine the spatiotemporal dependence of traffic data to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction. Compared to several baseline models, the experimental results show that the model is 7% better than other models on several metrics and demonstrates the necessity of the module through ablation experiments. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The efficient scheduling of departure air traffic persists as one of the most challenging aspects of air traffic management in recent years. A proper sequencing enhances airport operations, minimises delay, and improves airspace capacity and traffic forecasting. This paper proposes a sequential hybridisation algorithm designed to assist air traffic controllers in determining the optimal departure sequence complying with the standard instrument departures (SIDs). The level of complexity increases when taking into account the departure runway constraints, the configuration of flight paths after takeoff, and the aircraft’s operational limits during the takeoff phase. Another challenging aspect is the wide diversity in aircraft types. The suggested approach proposes a Genetic algorithm (GA) strengthened with the Partially Mixed Crossover technique (PMX). The initial population of the GA is enhanced with the Shortest Job First (SJF) method. This sequential hybridisation algorithm dynamically arranges the departure traffic sequence based on their performances and the complexity of the followed SIDs. © 2025 International Academic Press

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a crucial element of intelligent transportation system and has numerous practical applications for public safety and resource management. Accurate traffic forecasting presents a significant challenge due to the intricate and ever-changing spatio-temporal correlations of traffic data. Consequently, numerous spatio-temporal networks have been developed to address the challenge. However, many existing spatio-temporal networks are based on end-to-end training and still suffer from some issues: (i) The end-to-end learning may lead to overfitting and capture some spurious correlations of traffic data; (ii) Most networks ignore the cross-dimensional global interactions between different dimensions of traffic data. This paper proposes a new cross-dimensional global interactive Transformer (CDGIT) to address these issues mentioned above. The proposed CDGIT decomposes complex traffic data into fluctuating events and stable trends using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and then utilizes a dual-channel spatio-temporal network to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Specifically, cross-dimensional interactive attention (CDIA) and global multi-scale attention (GMSA) modules are proposed to extract the temporal correlation of events and trends, respectively, and local-global Transformer encoder (LGTE) module is developed to extract local and global spatial correlations. In addition, graph position encoding based on graph wavelets is introduced to balance the local-global structural information. Finally, the forecasting results are obtained by an adaptive fusion module that uses the attention mechanism and is learned by backpropagation. A series of comprehensive experiments conducted on three actual traffic datasets have demonstrated that the proposed CDGIT is more effective and superior compared to other traffic forecasting methods. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is the foundation and core task of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Due to the powerful ability of Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture topological features, recently, it is commonly used in traffic forecasting to capture spatial features of road networks. Although existing GNN based traffic forecasting methods have achieved satisfactory results, they are still plagued by the following problems: (1) Traffic time-series usually contains complex periodic features, but they only model 1D time features, ignoring multi-periodic information in traffic data. (2) There are multivariate higher-order correlations among nodes in road networks, but they only preserve the pairwise connections by simple graphs, neglecting the higher-order multivariate correlations. (3) They cannot adaptively capture unique patterns of specific areas, only learn the shared patterns of traffic time-series. To solve the above problems, we propose a Periodicity aware spatial-temporal Adaptive Hypergraph Neural Network (PAHNN). Firstly, a temporal multi-periodic block is designed to capture the 2D-variations of traffic time-series to extract multi-periodic features and complex temporal patterns. Then, we propose a spatial adaptive hypergraph block to model spatial multivariate correlations among nodes via hypergraph neural networks. Adaptive selection of hypergraph networks for different data can extract specific spatial patterns of different traffic areas. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two types of forecasting tasks to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of our model. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Traffic forecasting using Deep Learning has been a remarkably active and innovative research field during the last decades. However, there are still several barriers to real-world, large-scale implementation of Deep Learning forecasting models, including their data requirements, limited explainability and low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel theory-driven framework that is based on a Granger causality-inspired feature selection method and a multitask LSTM to jointly predict two traffic variables. Traffic flow theory intuition is induced in the training process by an enhanced Traffic Flow Theory-Informed loss function (TFTI loss), which includes the divergence of the joint prediction of two traffic variables from the actual fundamental diagram of the corresponding location. The theory-informed, Granger causal, multitask LSTM is trained for one step ahead volume and speed forecasting using loop detector data coming from the extended Athens road network (Greece). Findings indicate that the models trained using the TFTI loss and a reduced input space, which includes only causal information, achieve a significantly improved performance, compared to the models using the classic Mean Squared Error loss function. Moreover, we introduce a dedicated trustworthiness evaluation framework that indicates that the proposed approach enhances the trustworthiness of the predictions, as well as the models’ transparency and resilience to noisy data. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic forecasting can enhance the efficiency of traffic control strategies such as routing decisions, variable speed limits, and ramp metering, resulting in a decrease in congestion, pollutants, and expenses, and an improvement in journey time predictability. Traffic forecasting, however, remains challenging because of the complex, heterogeneous, and cyclic nature of traffic data. To address this complexity, this research employs a multi-input hybrid deep self-attention network (MIHDSAN) for multilocation forecasting. The model inputs are selected using correlation analysis. New tunable loss and evaluation metrics formulations are proposed based on the traffic-modeling Geoffrey E. Havers (GEH) statistic. The proposed method was validated on two independent real-world traffic datasets from Stockton and Oakland, California. The weekly periodicity was the more relevant periodic input feature compared with daily variations; however, the daily variation was also significant for the Stockton dataset. The inclusion of weekly traffic periodicity (>95% correlated) improved the performance of the model by 3%. Adding daily periodicity was only beneficial for the Stockton dataset (91% correlated). The proposed GEH metric and its standard acceptance criterion offer both quantitative and qualitative means of evaluating the forecasts produced. The GEH loss function was consistent and outperformed current industry-standard methodologies of mean absolute error (MAE) in 80% and mean squared error (MSE) in 94% of cases. Therefore, this research presents evidence to suggest that the proposed GEH loss and evaluation functions validated in this paper become a standard criterion for traffic forecasting. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - With the increasing demand for internet access and the advent of technologies such as 6G and IoT, efficient and dynamic network resource management has become crucial. Accurate network traffic prediction plays a pivotal role in this context. However, existing prediction methods often struggle with challenges such as complexity-accuracy trade-offs, limited data availability, and diverse traffic patterns, especially in coarsegrained forecasting. To address these issues, this article proposes ETCN-NNC-LB, which is a novel ensemble learning method for network traffic forecasting. ETCN-NNC-LB combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) with No Negative Constraint Theory (NNCT) weight integration in ensemble learning and is optimized using the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb- Shanno with Box constraints (L-BFGS-B) algorithm. This method balances model complexity and accuracy, mitigates overfitting risks, and flexibly aggregates predictions. The ETCN-NNC-LB model also incorporates a pattern-handling method to forecast traffic behaviors robustly. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ETCN-NNC-LB significantly outperforms stateof-the-art methods, achieving an approximately 22% reduction in the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed method provides accurate and efficient network traffic prediction in dynamic, data-constrained environments. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic prediction is critical for urban planning and transportation management, with significant implications for congestion reduction, resource allocation, and sustainability. Traditional statistical models struggle to capture the complex spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic data, leading to reduced accuracy. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a more practical approach due to their ability to model these intricate relationships. However, GNN-based methods face challenges in hyperparameter selection, which impacts their performance across diverse traffic scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive traffic prediction model that uses reinforcement learning to optimize GNN hyperparameters. Our model significantly reduces the need for manual tuning and improves prediction accuracy across real-world traffic datasets, achieving a 9.8% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 3.6% improvement in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. In conclusion, dynamic hyperparameter adaptation boosts robustness and efficiency in traffic forecasting. This approach also helps us better understand how to fine-tune GNNs, contributing to the broader knowledge of optimizing machine learning models. Our work helps make traffic prediction more automated and improves how to manage urban transportation. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is a critical task in intelligent transportation systems. However, cross-city data-driven prediction models encounter numerous challenges. A principal issue is data scarcity in underdeveloped cities, resulting from inadequate data collection mechanisms. Additionally, these models frequently rely exclusively on direct spatio-temporal traffic data, often deficient in thorough extraction and lateral exploration of external information from source cities, thereby introducing risks of negative transfer. This paper presents KGD-Transfer, a knowledge graph-driven cross-city traffic flow prediction framework that utilizes the extensive semantic information embedded within knowledge graphs. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we advocate for the construction of Fused Meta-Knowledge (FMk) from multiple source cities to facilitate precise traffic prediction. Our knowledge fusion network (Ka-net) deeply integrates heterogeneous knowledge graphs with traffic data. Following this, we apply Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) to extract intricate spatio-temporal features from the integrated knowledge. Furthermore, the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework is utilized to efficiently minimize the risk of negative transfer in cross-city learning. This approach enables the transfer of fused source knowledge by employing non-shared parameters to perform deep feature matching across cities, capitalizing on the spatio-temporal commonalities within the FMk. Experimental results from four real datasets illustrate that the inclusion of contextual information from knowledge graphs markedly enhances the prediction model’s understanding and reasoning capabilities. KGD-Transfer outperforms advanced baseline methods in both short-term (10 min) and long-term (60 min) predictions, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalizability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The advent of advanced sensor technologies has enabled the collection of rich traffic data in smart cities, paving the way for data-driven traffic forecasting services. These services play a vital role in optimizing traffic management, alleviating congestion, and enhancing transportation system efficiency. Although existing Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have made strides in traffic prediction by leveraging multiple graph perspectives, they often overlook the dynamic nature of traffic networks and fail to fully integrate the impact of traffic accidents. To address these limitations, we introduce the Accident Impact Multi-Expert Network (AIMEN), which incorporates the Accident Impact Learning Expert (AILE) to encode detailed accident profiles and generate Accident Propagation Graphs that model how accidents influence traffic patterns across road networks. AIMEN also employs Spatiotemporal Learning Experts (STLEs) to capture varying spatial relationships through distinct graph views, enhancing the model’s ability to adapt to changing traffic conditions. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that AIMEN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 5.06% and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 4.76% compared to suboptimal results. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The development of techniques able to forecast the mobile network traffic in a city can feed data driven applications, as Virtual Network Functions (VNF) orchestrators, optimizing the resource allocation and increasing the capacity of mobile networks. Despite the fact that several studies have addressed this problem, many did not consider neither the traffic relationship among city regions nor the information retrieved from public transport stations, which may provide useful information to better anticipate the network traffic. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning based architecture to forecast the network traffic using representation learning and recurrent neural networks. The framework, named Mobile Traffic Predictor Enhanced by Neighboring and Transportation Data (MTP-NT), has two major components: the first one is responsible of learning from the time series of the region to be predicted, with the second one learning from the time series of both neighboring regions and public transportation stations. Several experiments were conducted over a dataset from the city of Milan, as well as comparisons against widely adopted and state-of-the-art techniques. The results shown in this paper demonstrate that the usage of public transport information contributes to improve the forecasts in central areas of the city, as well as in regions with aperiodic demands, such as tourist regions.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in establishing an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) by providing essential insights. Existing traffic forecasting relies on the assumption that there is a hidden invariant spatial-temporal pattern in the large-scale dataset. However, the traffic patterns are easily influenced by many unpredictable external factors, such as policy interventions and climate changes. Due to the dynamic nature of these exogenous factors, the traffic network's spatial-temporal patterns are also changed, thus impacting the performance of traffic forecasting models. Thus, there is an urgent need to rethink the traffic forecasting model in a fast-adaptive manner. To solve this challenge, this paper proposes an Adaptive Spatio Temporal Context Learning framework named ASTCL, which achieves desired forecasting accuracy using daily basis traffic data collected from dozens of sensors. ASTCL constructs adaptive spatio-temporal contexts for target locations in the traffic network and generates dynamic sequence graphs based on semantic similarities. The adaptive contexts aggregate valuable information from available data, while the graphs reveal dynamic trends in traffic properties. Further, ASTCL introduces a joint convolution and attention mechanism to model intricate spatio-temporal relationships from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that ASTCL achieves remarkable fast adaptability and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies in road networks. We propose MapsTSF, a novel framework that enhances traffic forecasting by integrating three innovative components. Spatial path embedding uses multiple traversal algorithms to capture dynamic spatial flow patterns across road networks. The hybrid Mamba2-transformer model combines Mamba2’s selective state-space modeling with transformer’s global attention to effectively capture intricate spatiotemporal dependencies. Additionally, the cross adaptive periodic sparse forecasting mechanism decouples periodic and trend features, reducing computational overhead while preserving high accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MapsTSF outperforms baseline methods by an average of 18.80% in MAE, 15.69% in RMSE, and 19.80% in MAPE. With its scalable and efficient design, MapsTSF is well-suited for real-time traffic management in smart cities and navigation applications, providing precise and reliable forecasts for large-scale, dynamic road networks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Spatiotemporal traffic data (STTD) displays complex correlational structures. Extensive advanced techniques have been designed to capture these structures for effective forecasting. However, because STTD is often massive in scale, practitioners need to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency using computationally efficient models. An alternative paradigm based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) called MLP-Mixer has the potential for both simplicity and effectiveness. Taking inspiration from its success in other domains, we propose an adapted version, named NexuSQN, for STTD forecast at scale. We first identify the challenges faced when directly applying MLP-Mixers as series- and window-wise multivaluedness. To distinguish between spatial and temporal patterns, the concept of ST-contextualization is then proposed. Our results surprisingly show that this simple-yet-effective solution can rival SOTA baselines when tested on several traffic benchmarks. Furthermore, NexuSQN has demonstrated its versatility across different domains, including energy and environment data, and has been deployed in a collaborative project with Baidu to predict congestion in megacities like Beijing and Shanghai. Our findings contribute to the exploration of simple-yet-effective models for real-world STTD forecasting. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic flow prediction is essential for optimizing traffic management, enhancing road safety, and reducing environmental impacts. However, traditional models face challenges with long sequence data with multi-sensors, demanding substantial memory and computational resources, resulting in slow inference times due to the lack of a unified summary state. This paper introduces ST-MambaSync, a novel unified traffic prediction model that uniquely integrates Mamba and Transformer technologies with balanced computational cost and higher accuracy. Our contributions include: (1) We present the first theoretical investigation demonstrating that Mamba functions as a specialized form of attention mechanism with ResNet structure, enhancing its ability to capture local features critical for traffic pattern recognition; (2) We provide the first theoretical proof of the complementary nature between Mamba and Transformer technologies, showing how their respective strengths in local and global feature extraction work synergistically to improve overall performance; and (3) we validate these benefits through extensive experiments with reducing MAE by 0.70%, RMSE by 0.62%, and MAPE by 0.31%. Also, a 64.86% reduction in inference time and a 19.44% reduction in training time compared to the formal state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, establishing new benchmarks for accuracy and processing speed. This breakthrough sets new standards in traffic flow prediction and has significant implications for urban planning and real-time traffic management. © 2024

AB  - The efficient management and prediction of urban traffic flow are paramount in the age of beyond 5G smart cities and advanced transportation systems. Traditional methods often fail to handle the nonlinear and dynamic nature of traffic data, necessitating more advanced solutions. This paper introduces NeuroSync, a novel neural network architecture designed to leverage the strengths of spiking neuron layers and gated recurrent units (GRUs) combined with temporal pattern attention mechanisms to effectively forecast traffic patterns. The architecture is specifically tailored to address the complexities inherent in nonstationary urban traffic datasets, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships within the data. NeuroSync not only outperforms traditional forecasting models such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing but also shows significant improvement over contemporary neural network approaches like LSTM, CNN, Seq2Seq, RNN, GRU, Transformer, and Autoencoder in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The model's efficacy is demonstrated through extensive experiments with real-world traffic data, underscoring its potential to enhance urban mobility management and support the infrastructure of intelligent transportation systems. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The transportation department relies on accurate traffic forecasting for effective decision-making. However, determining relevant parameters for existing traffic flow prediction models poses challenges. To address this issue, this study proposes a hybrid model, sparrow search algorithm-gated recurrent unit-long short-term memory (SSA-GRU-LSTM), which leverages the SSA to optimize the GRUs and LSTM networks. The SSA is employed to identify the optimal parameters for the GRU-LSTM model, mitigating their impact on prediction accuracy. This model integrates the predictive efficiency of the GRU, LSTM's capability in temporal data analysis, and the fast convergence and global search attributes of the SSA. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method via traffic flow datasets, and the results are compared with those of baseline models. The numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the SSA-GRU-LSTM model. Compared with the baselines, the proposed model results in reductions in the root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.632%-45.206%, the mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.608%-53.327%, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.324%-13.723%, and an increase in R2 of 0.5%-17.5%. Consequently, the SSA-GRU-LSTM model has high prediction accuracy and measurement stability.  © 2018 Tsinghua University Press.

AB  - The ability to perform mobile traffic forecasting effectively with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is instrumental to optimize resource management in 5G and beyond generation mobile networks. However, despite their capabilities, these Deep Neural Networks (DNN)s often act as complex opaque-boxes with decisions that are difficult to interpret. Even worse, they have proven vulnerable to adversarial attacks which undermine their applicability in production networks. Unfortunately, although existing state-of-the-art EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are often demonstrated in computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP), they may not fully address the unique challenges posed by spatio-temporal time-series forecasting models. To address these challenges, we introduce DeExp in this paper, a tool that flexibly builds upon legacy EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to synthesize compact explanations by making it possible to understand which Base Stations (BSs) are more influential for forecasting from a spatio-temporal perspective. Armed with such knowledge, we run state-of-the-art Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) techniques on those BSs to measure the accuracy degradation of the predictors under adversarial attacks. Our comprehensive evaluation uses real-world mobile traffic datasets and demonstrates that legacy XAI techniques spot different types of vulnerabilities. While Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GC) is suitable to spot BSs sensitive to moderate/low traffic injection, LayeR-wise backPropagation (LRP) is suitable to identify BSs sensitive to high traffic injection. Under moderate adversarial attacks, the prediction error of the BSs identified as vulnerable can increase by more than 250%. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate real-time traffic prediction in intelligent transportation systems, remains a challenging task because of the frequently changing spatio-temporal dependencies, complex dynamics of the network and varying traffic density. While, existing methods have widely explored the hidden linkages for real-time traffic prediction, multi-faceted interactions between various traffic signals can play an important role in improving the accuracy rate of such systems. This work presents a novel method for analyzing the interrelated interactions between different features of traffic signals through a co-related channeled-spatio-temporal graph attention network. The proposed model is aimed to reflect the intricate channel, temporal and spatial connections between various traffic signal components. The model learns three different embeddings to describe the interactions between traffic signals using graph attention networks. These embeddings are in-line with the signals temporal dynamics, spatial interactions, and channel-based features. Correlation score is used to evaluate the degree of similarity between nodes in various time windows, which ultimately aids in the selection of the most important data. The proposed model is able to outperform various state-of-the-art methods in a series of trials on five real-world datasets. A comprehensive analysis of the results prove that the proposed model not only captures the spatio-temporal correlations in traffic patterns, but is also able to take into account the interactions between traffic signals and their impact on traffic flow changes over time, leading to a 9.7% improved error rate. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid expansion of smart cities, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are assuming an increasingly pivotal role. Among the multitude of tasks within ITS, traffic state forecasting stands out. As city boundaries grow, traffic forecasting encounters scalability and network transmission challenges. This research contributes to traffic state forecasting within large-scale, massive Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. By investigating an urban expressway managing architecture that employs LoRaWAN communication, a novel deep learning-based model named Time Alignment based Temporal-Graph Attention Network (TATGaN) is proposed. Using the temporal-graph attention mechanism, TATGaN is able to extract temporal-spatial information and predict traffic state accurately. Moreover, the time alignment block makes TATGaN capable of handling irregular sequences given by the asynchronous arrival of packets. Simulation results based on OSM data of a specific region within Abu Dhabi show that TATGaN outperforms existing baseline methods in prediction performance with lower error and the higher reliability. Furthermore, the performance evaluation demonstrates the suitability of TATGaN for large-scale traffic network scenarios, attributing its efficiency to the transmission schedule and parameter mechanisms in LoRaWAN networks.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic flow forecasting plays a vital role in the effective management and control of intelligent transportation systems. However, existing forecasting methods face constraints due to insufficient information sharing and a limited understanding of global temporal relationships, impeding a thorough analysis of temporal and spatial features. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called ST-DGCPSA (spatio-temporal dynamic graph probabilistic sparse attention networks) for traffic flow forecasting. This framework serves as a general forecasting solution, effectively extracting the temporal and spatial characteristics of traffic flow. First, a temporal graph convolution block is constructed, treating historical time slots as graph nodes and employing graph convolution to capture flexible global temporal dependencies. Next, a dynamic graph constructor is designed to explore spatial correlations between nodes and dynamic temporal dependencies across different time points, fully extracting dynamic spatio-temporal relationships. Finally, the spatio-temporal convolution block enhances the model’s ability to capture spatial correlations, temporal dependencies, and multi-scale modeling through the probabilistic sparse attention mechanism, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. The experimental results on four real datasets demonstrate the superiority of ST-DGCPSA over existing techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays an important role in traffic management and travel planning. Inspired by natural language processing, this paper analogizes traffic sensors to words and traffic features of sensor data to word meanings. Traffic conditions upstream and downstream of a chokepoint affect its flow, similar to how context influences the meaning of utterances. Based on this analogy, this paper constructs a road semantic graph and proposes a context-based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (CSTGCN) model for traffic prediction. Firstly, this paper introduces Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to calculate the similarity of traffic features of nodes, constructs a road semantic graph, and mines and utilizes the implicit information in similar traffic patterns. Secondly, based on the road semantic graph, we build an adaptive spatio-temporal Graph Attention Network (GAT) component. The component designs an adaptive function to extract the changing spatial features, which realizes the dynamic capture of multi-order neighborhood spatial features in different periods. In addition, we designed a geo-semantic fusion module based on a convolutional neural network (GS-CNN). This module combines the real-time traffic of sensors and realizes the multi-dimensional dynamic fusion of spatio-temporal features by assigning weights to different features. Experiments show that CSTGCN can deeply mine the spatio-temporal correlation of sensors in the road network, and the model has a more obvious accuracy improvement in traffic prediction performance compared with the current baseline method. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Real-time and accurate traffic forecasting aids in traffic planning and design and helps to alleviate congestion. Addressing the negative impacts of partial data loss in traffic forecasting, and the challenge of simultaneously capturing short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, this paper presents a traffic forecasting model, D-MGDCN-CLSTM, based on Multi-Graph Gated Dilated Convolution and Conv-LSTM. The model uses the DTWN algorithm to fill in missing data. To better capture the dual characteristics of short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in traffic, the model employs the DWT for multi-scale decomposition to obtain approximation and detail coefficients. The Conv-LSTM processes the approximation coefficients to capture the long-term characteristics of the time series, while the multiple layers of the MGDCN process the detail coefficients to capture short-term fluctuations. The outputs of the two branches are then merged to produce the forecast results. The model is tested against 10 algorithms using the PeMSD7(M) and PeMSD7(L) datasets, improving MAE, RMSE, and ACC by an average of 1.38% and 13.89%, 1% and 1.24%, and 5.92% and 1%, respectively. Ablation experiments, parameter impact analysis, and visual analysis all demonstrate the superiority of our decompositional approach in handling the dual characteristics of traffic data. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays an essential role in urban planning and traffic management. Nevertheless, the intricate spatio-temporal connections in traffic data make traffic prediction particularly tough. Although many traffic prediction methods have been developed, most of them fail to effectively model the decomposition of multiple traffic modes in traffic conditions, and it is also difficult to dynamically capture spatio-temporal dependencies between roads without relying on prior knowledge. A framework called Multi-scale Fusion Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MDGCRN) is developed to tackle these difficulties. The approach initially separates intricate traffic conditions into trend and detail components, which are subsequently predicted independently using the dynamic graph convolutional recurrent network. Within this network, we propose a technique for creating dynamic graphs that, when combined with GRU, effectively captures short-term and long-term temporal information as well as spatial information. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that MDGCRN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines across all metrics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The escalating challenges in urban traffic highlight the importance of accurate traffic forecasting for enhancing the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), given its pivotal role in optimizing traffic management strategies. Due to the impressive performance of Graph Neural Networks in spatio-temporal data analysis, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream approach for traffic forecasting. However, many recent STGNN-based works often utilize redundant and intricate architectures, leading to increased computational costs with only minor improvements in performance. To solve this issue, we propose a concise but effective Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Neural Network architecture, LSTNN. Specifically, we design two sampling strategies, downsampling and patched sampling, to decompose the time series and separately fit the seasonal component and trend components. Based on sampling strategies, we introduce a spatio-temporal localization module based on the raw traffic data and learnable spatio-temporal indexing. In particular, this module models spatio-temporal correlations by appending the spatio-temporal indexing to the traffic sequences. We visualized the spatio-temporal indexing, confirming the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal localization module design. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely utilized real-world traffic datasets, showing the significant improvement of LSTNNcompared to baselines, including several state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we conducted extensive experiments on four long-term time series datasets to validate the effectiveness of LSTNNin the Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) task. Our findings may inspire and encourage the design of more concise neural prediction architectures for real-world applications.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is crucial for a variety of applications, including route optimization, signal management, and travel time estimation. However, many existing prediction models struggle to accurately capture the spatiotemporal patterns in traffic data due to its inherent nonlinearity, high dimensionality, and complex dependencies. To address these challenges, a short-term traffic forecasting model, Trafficformer, is proposed based on the Transformer framework. The model first uses a multilayer perceptron to extract features from historical traffic data, then enhances spatial interactions through Transformer-based encoding. By incorporating road network topology, a spatial mask filters out noise and irrelevant interactions, improving prediction accuracy. Finally, traffic speed is predicted using another multilayer perceptron. In the experiments, Trafficformer is evaluated on the Seattle Loop Detector dataset. It is compared with six baseline methods, with Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and Root Mean Square Error used as metrics. The results show that Trafficformer not only has higher prediction accuracy, but also can effectively identify key sections, and has great potential in intelligent traffic control optimization and refined traffic resource allocation.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is vital for optimizing intelligent transportation systems (ITS), yet existing models often struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal patterns of urban traffic. We present GAPDE (Graph Attention Partial Differential Equation), a novel framework that integrates Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and advanced attention mechanisms. GAPDE enables continuous-time spatio-temporal modeling and dynamically prioritizes critical features through attention-driven traffic forecasting. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including PEMS-BAY, METR-LA, and various PeMS collections (PeMS03, PeMS04, PeMS07, PeMS08, PeMSD7M, and PeMSD7L), demonstrate GAPDE's superior performance over state-of-the-art models such as RGDAN, SGODE-RNN, and STD-MAE. GAPDE achieves up to 9.2 percent lower RMSE and 10.4 percent lower MAE, outperforming baselines in both short- and long-term prediction tasks. It demonstrates strong robustness to missing data, high scalability for large-scale networks, and enhanced interpretability through spatial and temporal attention visualizations. Comprehensive comparative evaluations and an in-depth ablation study further validate the effectiveness of GAPDE's components, including the GPDE block and spatio-temporal attention mechanisms. By combining PDEs, GCNs, and attention mechanisms in a scalable and efficient design, GAPDE offers a robust solution for real-time traffic forecasting in complex urban environments. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Accurate traffic flow forecasting is crucial for urban traffic control, planning, and detection. Most existing spatial-temporal modeling methods overlook the hidden dynamic correlations between road network nodes and the time series nonstationarity while synchronously capturing complex long- and short-term spatial-temporal dependencies. To this end, this paper proposes an Attention-based Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional Network (AST-SGCN) to capture complex spatial-temporal correlations over long and short terms. Specifically, we design a self-attention mechanism that utilizes spatial-temporal synchronous computation to efficiently mine dynamic spatial-temporal correlations with changes in traffic and enhance computational efficiency. Then, we construct a residual adaptive adjacency matrix, which includes historical data and node vectors, to stimulate the information transfer of spatial-temporal graph nodes and mine the hidden spatial-temporal dependencies through the graph convolution layer. Next, we establish a Fourier transform layer (FTL) to handle the nonstationary data. Finally, we develop a spatial-temporal hybrid stacking module for capturing complex long-term spatial-temporal correlations, within which two layers of graph convolution and one layer of self-attention are deployed. Extensive experimental results on three real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our AST-SGCN model outperforms the comparable models. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is essential for the development of intelligent transportation systems. However, existing forecasting models often struggle to effectively capture the complex spatial-temporal dependencies inherent in traffic data. Many current approaches are limited in their ability to model node-specific patterns and to simultaneously capture both short- and long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic forecasting model, the Meta Attentive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MAGCRN), which addresses these limitations through two key modules: (1) Node-Specific Meta Pattern Learning (NMPL) and (2) Node Attention Weight Generation (NAWG). The NMPL module captures the unique characteristics of each node in the traffic network by dynamically generating node-specific convolutional filters. The NAWG module enhances the model's ability to capture both short- and long-range temporal dependencies by generating attention weights that connect node-specific features with those across the entire temporal dimension. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that MAGCRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both traffic flow and speed prediction tasks.

AB  - Among many traffic forecasting studies, comparatively fewer studies focus on long-term traffic prediction, such as 24-hour prediction. While traffic data such as traffic speed are easier to obtain, obtaining similarly reliable and accessible feature data with the inclusion of weather or events would be difficult depending on the location or availability of the service providers. Getting these data becomes a more significant issue when considering global coverage. To mitigate the issue of limited feature data, a method to augment already existing data by improving the dataset's quality and ensuring more accurate training via sorting the dataset into appropriate clusters to be used as an additional feature is proposed. This paper proposes a long-term traffic forecasting model that utilizes a novel time-series segmentation method paired with data clustering and classification via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to cover the lack of traffic data and features as additional pre-processing before using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for long-term traffic prediction which is not researched as much. This proposed model is called Cluster Augmented LSTM (CAL). The proposed model is compared with existing machine learning models and evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) performance metrics. A comparison between LSTM and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) was conducted, showing that GRU tends to outperform LSTM in most cases. However, the best-performing result for the proposed method still utilizes LSTM. The final results show that the proposed CAL model could achieve better results by 1.42 %-1.76 % and 0.25–0.41 for MAPE and RMSE, respectively. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Traffic congestion represents a significant urban challenge, with notable implications for public health and environmental well-being. Consequently, urban decision-makers prioritize the mitigation of congestion. This study delves into the efficacy of harnessing extensive data on urban traffic dynamics, coupled with comprehensive knowledge of road networks, to enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in forecasting traffic flux well in advance. Such forecasts hold promise for informing emission reduction measures, particularly those aligned with Low Emission Zone policies. The investigation centers on Valencia, leveraging its robust traffic sensor infrastructure, one of the most densely deployed worldwide, encompassing approximately 3500 sensors strategically positioned across the city. Employing historical data spanning 2016 and 2017, we undertake the task of training and characterizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network for the prediction of temporal traffic patterns. Our findings demonstrate the LSTM's efficacy in real-time forecasting of traffic flow evolution, facilitated by its ability to discern salient patterns within the dataset. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - With the increasing number of distributed edge intelligence (DEI) sensors in cities, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems can obtain more fine-grained information. The information plays a crucial role in tasks, such as road monitoring and traffic forecasting. However, graph-based methods used in IoV systems mainly have two limitations: i) They struggle to achieve both efficiency and high prediction performance, and ii) Most lack user-friendly interfaces to intuitively display data collected by DEI sensors and prediction results. To alleviate the first limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, the gating memory network multilayer perceptron (GMMLP). In the model, the traditional time-consuming graph-based operations are replaced with multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). A gating mechanism is employed to help reduce redundant information from raw input. An integrated memory network is utilized to memorize common patterns implicitly. To alleviate the second limitation and make GMMLP more accessible, we design a DEI-based human-computer interaction and visualization system called the traffic easy access system (TEAS). Traffic departments and ordinary users can access roads in the state recorded by DEI sensors on multiple terminals. Professionals can easily train and test traffic forecasting models by using this system. We validate the performance of our proposed model on multiple datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves excellent performance in both inference efficiency and prediction accuracy.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Web traffic forecasting is critical for ensuring an effective allocation of network resources for websites to avoid potential congestion and maintain service quality. Analyzing traffic forecasts helps network operators plan for future capacity needs to accommodate unexpected traffic loads. Multilingual web platforms present unique challenges due to varying traffic patterns across several languages. In this paper, modular architecture is proposed for multilingual web traffic forecasting using deep learning models. The architecture consists of multiple processes, from collecting the traffic data of the targeted website to preparing the data to be in a suitable form to feed the deep learning models. This study explores time-series forecasting methods using three deep learning models: long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). A comprehensive dataset was collected from the BBC World Service websites in three languages—English, Arabic, and Persian—spanning the period from January 2017 to July 2024. The performance of the employed deep learning models is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), and R-squared (R²). Results show that the CNN model outperformed the GRU and LSTM models in accuracy and variance explanation across all three language datasets. The CNN model demonstrated superior performance, achieving R² scores of 0.980, 0.989, and 0.994; MAE values of 47,195, 5090, and 6714; RRMSE values of 1.43 %, 1.90 %, and 1.86 %; and RMSE values of 61,372, 6342, and 9376 for the English, Arabic, and Persian websites, respectively. These results highlight the potential of deep learning models in capturing complicated patterns of multilingual web platforms, making them suitable for real-world network management. © 2025

AB  - Accurate traffic prediction is crucial for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, recent advancements in deep learning have encountered significant challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies and modeling complex inter-variable relationships, particularly under real-time processing constraints. These limitations primarily arise from the inherent trade-off in current model architectures: while some are optimized for short-term forecasting with constrained receptive fields, others prioritize long-term prediction accuracy at the cost of computational efficiency. Moreover, the dynamic and intricate interactions among nodes present significant scalability challenges, increasingly hindering efficient modeling as the road network grows. To address these limitations, we propose TWIST (temporal window and sparse spatial attention transformer), a novel architecture specifically designed for traffic forecasting. The proposed framework incorporates two key innovations: (1) a trend-aware window attention mechanism in the temporal dimension that effectively and efficiently captures multi-scale temporal dynamics, and (2) a sparse attention mechanism in the spatial dimension that optimizes computational efficiency by selectively focusing on significant spatial nodes. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that TWIST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various scenarios, including regular, long-term and large-scale traffic forecasting tasks, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Understanding individual and crowd dynamics in urban environments is critical for numerous applications, such as urban planning, traffic forecasting, and location-based services. Therefore, accurately modeling individuals' daily activity schedules is essential. Traditional methods, like utility-based and rule-based approaches, rely on expert knowledge and presumed model structures. While machine learning methods offer flexibility, they often ignore explicit behavioral mechanisms, particularly comprehensive discussion and integration of context related to individuals' daily travel. To address these, we propose a framework that integrates travel context with deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), learning temporal patterns from sociodemographics, start time and duration of the current activity, travel modes, and land use. Specifically, individuals' activity schedules are initially formulated as a Markov Decision Process to simulate travelers’ sequential decision-making processes, laying the groundwork for the IRL framework; Then, a context-aware IRL method is proposed to model individuals' travel decision-making from observed temporal trajectories. Finally, we validate the proposed model by demonstrating its superior performance over discrete choice model and several well-known imitation learning benchmarks in tasks such as policy performance comparison, reward recovery, model generalizability, and computational efficiency using travel behavior datasets. This approach provides meaningful behavioral insights and paves the way for Artificial Intelligence-driven activity schedulers modeling. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic datasets exhibit complex spatiotemporal characteristics, including significant fluctuations in traffic volume and intricate periodical patterns, which pose substantial challenges for the accurate forecasting and effective management of traffic conditions. Traditional forecasting models often struggle to adequately capture these complexities, leading to suboptimal predictive performance. While neural networks excel at modeling intricate and nonlinear data structures, they are also highly susceptible to overfitting, resulting in inefficient use of computational resources and decreased model generalization. This paper introduces a novel heuristic feature extraction method that synergistically combines the strengths of non-neural network algorithms with neural networks to enhance the identification and representation of relevant features from traffic data. We begin by evaluating the significance of various temporal characteristics using three distinct assessment strategies grounded in non-neural methodologies. These evaluated features are then aggregated through a weighted fusion mechanism to create heuristic features, which are subsequently integrated into neural network models for more accurate and robust traffic prediction. Experimental results derived from four real-world datasets, collected from diverse urban environments, show that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of long-term traffic forecasting without compromising performance. Additionally, the approach helps streamline neural network architectures, leading to a considerable reduction in computational overhead. By addressing both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, this study not only presents an innovative and effective method for traffic condition forecasting but also offers valuable insights that can inform the future development of data-driven traffic management systems and transportation strategies.

AB  - To manage and make decisions about intelligent transportation systems more efficiently, accurate traffic flow forecasting is necessary. Traffic flow forecasting has complex spatial correlation and time dependence. Most current research models are based on a predefined graph structure with a priori knowledge for prediction, which cannot well extract the hidden spatial relationships in traffic data. In this paper, we propose the Optimal Graph Information Fused Graph Attention Network (OGIF-GAT). Specifically, we learn the actual connections between nodes and the hidden spatial relationships through the multigraph feature fusion structure. Next, we design a new graph attention network (GAT), which improves the problem of ignoring edge features in the graph structure in the traditional GAT model and considers their edge features when estimating the correlation of each neighboring node pair: the effect that the distance factor between neighboring nodes has on the spatial correlation. In addition, we use the temporal hybrid transformer (THT) to learn temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on four public transportation datasets (PeMS04, PeMS08, PeMS-BAY, and METR-LA) demonstrate that our model achieves the optimal level of traffic flow prediction accuracy on all of them and is shown to have strong generalization ability. Compared to STSGCN, the mean absolute error (MAE) decreases by 7.9%, 10.3%, 33.2%, and 19.6%, respectively. Copyright © 2025 Xing Xu et al.

AB  - Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) provides a flexible framework for network slicing in 4G/5G systems, with xApps enabling efficient near-real-time resource management. The purpose of slicing is to allocate resources in a way that meets the heterogeneous demands posed by diverse services, while minimizing the amount of unused resources. We demonstrate experimentally how xApps can support slicing through near real-time control of Radio Access Network (RAN) resources and at the same time avoid resource waste due to overprovisioning. We develop an open-loop implementation for Radio Resource Management (RRM) to allocate resources efficiently across slices to serve multiple users of Virtual Reality (VR) traffic with latency guarantees. Prior research concluded that VR traffic is highly variable in its demand. We evaluate the methods’ ability to meet latency targets and minimize overprovisioning under variable traffic using specialized xApps with open-loop prediction. Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs between the methods: our proposed solution, Latency Estimation Correction (LEC), offers superior latency control but at the cost of resource efficiency; it emphasizes estimating end-to-end latency and guides the allocation accordingly. Conversely, a simpler Packet Size Prediction (PSP) approach demonstrates improved resource efficiency, though it sacrifices control over latency. The method leverages traffic forecasting to predict the required allocation. This comparison underscores the balance between latency management and resource utilization in the context of network slicing and ORAN. Aggregating users reduces resource overprovisioning by 30%, though it introduces a slight increase in end-to-end latency offset. Across target latencies ranging from 10 to 16.67 ms, our evaluations show a stable average offset of 0.6 ms. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting has traditionally relied solely on characteristics related to services and users. However, recent research has highlighted the importance of considering travellers’ psychological factors in explaining travel behaviour. While previous studies have incorporated the role of habits in travel choice behaviour, only a few have analysed the role of inertia and shock related to major changes in transport networks. This study contributes to previous research by revealing the changes in the behaviour of public transport passengers over time after the inauguration of a new metro line in Santiago, Chile, using large-scale revealed-preference data from automated fare collection systems. It explicitly analysed the consequences of the new metro on passenger behaviour by considering different passenger types, using a heteroskedastic mixed latent class public transport mode choice model incorporating both inertia effects resulting from habitual behaviour and shock effects resulting from a significant change to the public transport network. The results confirmed significant habitual behaviour among passengers, in that metro users tended to stick to using the metro, but bus users tended to switch to other modes. However, after the introduction of the new metro line, a significant shock effect was observed, whereby users had an increased tendency to switch to modes that improved their level of service, and this effect increased slightly in the longer term. The results highlight the importance of incorporating inertia and shock effects into behavioural studies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Misallocation of resources and suboptimal transportation projects often stem from inaccurate traffic forecasts, impacting cost-benefit analyses. This pioneering study employs econometric methods to analyze forecast accuracy across entire networks, including often-overlooked non-project segments that are critical to cost-benefit analysis like project segments. Despite an overall underestimation of 12.3% (Mean Percentage Error), project segments consistently exhibit a historical overestimation (−13.8%). Notably, unbiasedness varies among segments, with low-volume segments achieving it statistically. Our analysis reveals intriguing associations between forecast and calibration errors specific to segments. While future forecasting error is statistically linked to forecasts for all segments except project segments, a similar connection between base-year model calibration error and future forecasting error is observed for all segments except low-volume and project segments. Remarkably, low-volume segments, though lacking unbiasedness, demonstrate efficiency during base year calibration, presenting contrasting results. Policy suggestions highlight the potential for forecasting enhancement through improved base-year calibration and question the necessity for separate error tolerances for low-volume segments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate traffic flow prediction is crucial for urban traffic management. Traffic data is typically collected from sensors deployed along roadways, which often record both valid and erroneous data. However, most existing studies assume that the collected data is perfectly accurate, overlooking the existence of erroneous data. Meanwhile, graph neural networks are widely applied in traffic forecasting due to their ability to effectively capture correlations between nodes in a network. However, existing methods often rely solely on either static or dynamic graph structures, which may not accurately reflect the complex spatial relationships between nodes. To address these issues, we propose a decomposition dynamic multi-graph convolutional recurrent network (DDMGCRN). DDMGCRN utilizes a residual decomposition mechanism to separate erroneous data from valid data, thereby mitigating its impact. Additionally, DDMGCRN introduces sensor-specific spatial identity embeddings and timestamp embeddings to construct dynamic graphs. It further integrates static graphs for multi-graph fusion, facilitating more effective spatial feature extraction. Furthermore, to address the limitations of RNN-based models in capturing global temporal dependencies, DDMGCRN incorporates a global temporal attention module. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that DDMGCRN outperforms all baseline models on the PEMS08 dataset, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.13, which improves performance by approximately 4.85% compared to the best baseline model.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is critical to the effectiveness of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and the development of smart cities.Achieving this goal requires efficient capture of heterogeneous interactions between spatial and temporal dependencies of traffic nodes.However, the robustness and predictive capacity of modeling systems are frequently compromised by the limitations inherent in fine-grained sensor data collection methodologies.Furthermore, the uneven distribution of data can exacerbate the degradation of the model's predictive performance.To tackle these challenges, we introduce an innovative neural network that leverages spatio-temporal feature interlace contrast learning for daily traffic flow prediction.Our approach consists of two main parts: First, we propose a spatiotemporal position encoder that aims to provide a more balanced sample of training spatiotemporal data with mixed spatial coding to solve the problem of local heterogeneity in the data.Secondly, we employ a spatiotemporal interlace contrast graph structure generator and a specific structure and direction discriminator to discern various potential spatiotemporal features and categorize samples based on trends and consistency, thereby augmenting the system's robustness and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments and case studies across six real datasets demonstrate that our approach markedly enhances the prediction accuracy of the baseline model and introduces novel prediction strategies aimed at boosting the system's robustness. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have become integral part in advancing next generation wireless communication systems by enabling sophisticated data modeling and feature extraction for enhanced network performance. In the realm of open radio access networks (O-RAN), characterized by their disaggregated architecture and heterogeneous components from multiple vendors, the deployment of generative models offers significant advantages for network management such as traffic analysis, traffic forecasting and anomaly detection. However, the complex and dynamic nature of O-RAN introduces challenges that necessitate not only accurate detection mechanisms but also reduced complexity, scalability, and most importantly interpretability to facilitate effective network management. In this study, we introduce the XAInomaly framework, an explainable and interpretable Semi-supervised (SS) Deep Contractive Autoencoder (DeepCAE) design for anomaly detection in O-RAN. Our approach leverages the generative modeling capabilities of our SS-DeepCAE model to learn compressed, robust representations of normal network behavior, which captures essential features, enabling the identification of deviations indicative of anomalies. To address the black-box nature of deep learning models, we propose reactive Explainable AI (XAI) technique called fastshap-C, which is providing transparency into the model's decision-making process and highlighting the features contributing to anomaly detection. © 2025

AB  - Human mobility is intricately influenced by urban contexts spatially and temporally, constituting essential domain knowledge in understanding traffic systems. While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to insufficient integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed utilizing these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG's configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model establishes a benchmark for 10-120 min predictions, achieving average MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of 3.46±0.01, 14.76±0.09%, and 5.08±0.01, respectively. Compared to the baseline DCRNN model, integrating the spatial unit improves the MAE by 0.04 and the temporal unit by 0.13, while integrating both units further reduces it by 0.18. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model's ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. Overall, this study underscores the importance of merging context-aware knowledge graphs with graph neural networks to improve traffic forecasting.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid acceleration of urbanization, traffic prediction plays a crucial role in smart city development. This paper proposes an architecture called Periodic Decomposition and Feature Enhancement Fusion (PDGM) aimed at addressing the periodicity issue overlooked in existing traffic prediction methods. PDGM utilizes downsampling techniques to decompose the original traffic data into periodic components and enhances missing data through feature enhancement fusion, thereby improving the accuracy of traffic data prediction. Experimental results of this study demonstrate that PDGM outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on three benchmark datasets, offering new possibilities for traffic data analysis and prediction tasks. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the proliferation of Intelligent applications, more and more organizations migrate their applications from cloud to edge cloud network to reduce the latency of applications and alleviate the workload of cloud. When the network congestion occurs, network monitoring and detection system may disable, and edge cloud network will be vulnerable to be attacked. Traffic forecasting can identify the traffic patterns in advance, and dynamically allocate network resources to decrease latency of applications and avoid security risks caused by network congestion. Therefore, we propose a network scheduling framework WVNF (Wavelet VMD Based Network Flow Management) based on traffic prediction, which utilizes neural networks to forecast network traffic and deploys route strategies to optimize network scheduling. Specifically, in order to accurately forecast network traffic, we propose a neural network model, named TSWNet (Traffic Sequence Wavelet Network). TSWNet uses VMD (variational mode decomposition) to decompose time series and extract signal structure information on different time scales, and adopts wavelet transformation to extract the local and global features of the traffic sequence in the time and frequency domain. In addition, we model this traffic scheduling problem and propose a route strategy, which utilizes the result of TSWNet to find the best path. In extensive tests, TSWNet significantly outperformed existing models, reducing MSE and MAE by up to 48.8% and 27.8% respectively, demonstrating its effective traffic prediction and network scheduling capabilities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is necessary to establish a spatio-temporal correlation model in the traffic data to predict the state of the transportation system. Existing research has focused on traditional graph neural networks, which use predefined graphs and have shared parameters. But intuitive predefined graphs introduce biases into prediction tasks and the fine-grained spatio-temporal information can not be obtained by the parameter sharing model. In this paper, we consider it is crucial to learn node-specific parameters and adaptive graphs with complete edge information. To show this, we design a model based on graph structure that decouples nodes and edges into two modules. Each module extracts temporal and spatial features simultaneously. The adaptive node optimization module is used to learn the specific parameter patterns of all nodes, and the adaptive edge optimization module aims to mine the interdependencies among different nodes. Then we propose a Decoupled Adaptive Graph Convolution Attention Network for Traffic Forecasting (DAGCAN), which relies on the above two modules to dynamically capture the fine-grained spatio-temporal relationships in traffic data. Experimental results on four public transportation datasets, demonstrate that our model can further improve the accuracy of traffic prediction. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic prediction is crucial for the functionality of Intelligent Transportation Systems(ITS). However, the significant nonlinearity and complexity of spatio-temporal relationships in traffic flow frequently constrain the predictive accuracy of many models, which often combine temporal and spatial components without effectively capturing spatio-temporal characteristics. To address this, we developed a Flow Attention-based Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (FADGCRN) model. FADGCRN combines a GRU model with flow attention and a dynamic graph convolutional recurrent network, utilizing efficient depthwise separable convolutions. It employs KAN’s learnable activation functions to generate dynamic graphs from time-varying traffic signals, enabling the simultaneous extraction of both spatial and temporal features. Additionally, the model integrates a flow attention mechanism based on the principle of network flow conservation, which is used for attention weight calculation within the GRU. This design allows the model to effectively allocate attention resources across different time steps, capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies in traffic flow more efficiently. Furthermore, by using LSTM, the model can map input data into various representational spaces. This approach enhances the model’s ability to capture temporal correlations when processing long sequences of data, while also minimizing the influence of specific inductive biases that traditional attention mechanisms may face. Through rigorous evaluation using four authentic traffic datasets, our model has shown remarkable performance, clearly exceeding that of other baseline models. © 2025, International Association of Engineers.

AB  - Forecasting the spatiotemporal distribution of mobile traffic is crucial for efficient cellular network management. Despite the superior performance of many deep learning studies, they remain inadequate for multi-city forecasting due to the neglect of geospatial effects in deep models. Specifically, spatial heterogeneity and geographical similarity suggest that distinct patterns exist within different urban regions, while shared patterns exist across different cities. To address this gap, this study proposes a Collaborative Specific-Shared Knowledge Learning (CSSKL) framework based on a meta-learning strategy for mobile traffic forecasting in two distinct cities. CSSKL consists of two key components: (1) a geographical learning module for capturing specific patterns using regional customization and (2) a geographical transfer strategy for capturing shared patterns using an attention mechanism. The effectiveness of CSSKL is validated through real-world mobile traffic datasets from two cities, namely Milan and Trentino, Italy. Experimental results demonstrate that CSSKL outperforms all baseline models, yielding a significant improvement in cross-city forecasting performance. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is the foundation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In recent, graph neural networks (GNNs) have successfully captured spatial-temporal dependencies to forecast traffic conditions by transforming traffic data in the graph domain. Nevertheless, the existing methods focus only on learning informative graph representations and fail to model informative graph structures, which hinders the capture of dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies caused by dynamic factors such as weather, accidents, and special events. In this paper, we propose a novel task-oriented Spatial Graph Structure Learning (SGSL) method, which aims to capture dynamic dependencies by jointly learning graph structures and graph representations. Compared to methods that use spectral graph representations, we exploit a learnable spatial graph to effectively model dynamic dependencies in traffic data. Moreover, we directly define graph convolutions on spatial relations to specify different edge weights when aggregating the information of spatial neighbours. Thus, the graph structure alterations, i.e., the relation changes, and the time-varying weights of relations can be encapsulated, thereby effectively representing dynamic dependencies. The gradient descent strategy is introduced to periodically learn a spatial graph through joint optimization with a newly designed deep graph learning model named GAT-nLSTM. In this manner, the intrinsic behaviours of nodes are learned to capture correlations across periods. Notably, the optimization process is performed under the traffic forecasting constraint to ensure that the learned spatial graph is specific to this task. Compared with those of state-of-the-art baselines, the experimental results obtained on real-world traffic datasets show significant improvement, which verifies the superiority of the proposed SGSL. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is one of the key applications within Internet of Things (IoT)-based intelligent transportation systems (ITS), playing a vital role in enhancing traffic quality, optimizing public transportation, and planning infrastructure. However, existing spatial-temporal methods encounter two primary limitations: 1) they have difficulty differentiating samples over time and often ignore dependencies among road network nodes at different time scales and 2) they are limited in capturing dynamic spatial correlations with predefined and adaptive graphs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel temporal identity interaction dynamic graph convolutional network (TIIDGCN) for traffic forecasting. The central concept involves assigning temporal identity features to raw data and extracting distinctive, representative spatial-temporal features through multiscale interactive learning. Specifically, we design a multiscale interactive model incorporating both spatial and temporal components. This network aims to explore spatial-temporal patterns at various scales from macro to micro, facilitating their mutual enhancement through positive feedback mechanisms. For the spatial component, we design a new dynamic graph learning method to depict the changing dependencies among nodes. We conduct comprehensive experiments using four real-world traffic datasets (PeMS04/07/08 and NYCTaxi Drop-off/Pick-up). Specifically, TIIDGCN achieves a 16.46% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Gated Recurrent Transformer Network model on the PeMS08 dataset. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, many works have been proposed for traffic forecasting to improve people's daily lives. Although these works have achieved good predictive performance, they have three fundamental limitations. (i) The regional features of traffic flow are not fully utilized; (ii) The discretized spatiotemporal features of traffic flow do not facilitate a full understanding of the actual traffic dynamic features; (iii) There is a lack of a dynamic and continuous features fusion mechanism between traffic regions and nodes. To address these issues, we propose a traffic forecasting model named Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential Equation Network (HSTGODE). HSTGODE adopts a dual-layer structure to simultaneously process the traffic flow data at traffic regions and nodes. In the traffic region and node layers, the model captures the characteristics of regions and nodes continuously and deeply through spatial–temporal ODE blocks. It effectively solves the problem of over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and understands hierarchical spatial–temporal features better. We propose a fusion mechanism to continuously integrate regional and node features multiple times through an attention mechanism and skip connections. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real traffic datasets from Xi'an and Jinan in China. The experimental results demonstrate that HSTGODE outperforms some of the current SOTA models. HSTGODE provides new insights into the hierarchical structure of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in traffic forecasting. We provide the source code and data of HSTGODE on GitHub (https://github.com/djm209/HSTGODE). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), aiding in efficient resource allocation and effective traffic control. However, its effectiveness often relies heavily on abundant traffic data, while many cities lack sufficient data due to limited device support, posing a significant challenge for traffic forecasting. Recognizing this challenge, we have made a noteworthy observation: traffic patterns exhibit similarities across diverse cities. Building on this key insight, we propose a solution for the cross-city few-shot traffic forecasting problem called Multi-scale Traffic Pattern Bank (MTPB). Primarily, MTPB initiates its learning process by leveraging data-rich source cities, effectively acquiring comprehensive traffic knowledge through a spatial-temporal-aware pre-training process. Subsequently, the framework employs advanced clustering techniques to systematically generate a multi-scale traffic pattern bank derived from the learned knowledge. Next, the traffic data of the data-scarce target city could query the traffic pattern bank, facilitating the aggregation of meta-knowledge. This meta-knowledge, in turn, assumes a pivotal role as a robust guide in subsequent processes involving graph reconstruction and forecasting. Empirical assessments conducted on real-world traffic datasets affirm the superior performance of MTPB, surpassing existing methods across various categories and exhibiting numerous attributes conducive to the advancement of cross-city few-shot forecasting methodologies.

AB  - Traffic flow on long-distance highways, especially at sections with multi-interchanges and ramps, exhibits nonlinear trends affected by long-term and short-term spatiotemporal dependencies, resulting limited fitting capabilities for the major applied spatiotemporal forecasting models in use. This paper tackles this challenge by integrating an incremental gate state output decomposition (IGOD) mechanism into the recurrent neural network (RNN) model framework, accounting for the interdependencies of spatiotemporal traffic data. The proposed method improves the ability of the RNN model to estimate traffic data series by segmenting consecutive time intervals and accumulating incremental changes across these time intervals, allowing for more precise traffic predictions. This study also explores how threshold amplitudes affect prediction effectiveness. We applied it to real traffic data from segment k602+630 to k625+420 on the Changjiu Highway. The results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently exhibits robustness, with variations in threshold magnitude having little impact on its prediction accuracy. © 2025 Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

AB  - In traffic forecasting, a key challenge lies in capturing both long-term temporal dependencies and inter-node relationships. While recent work has addressed long-term dependencies using Transformer-based models, the handling of inter-node relationships remains limited. Most studies rely on predefined or adaptive adjacency matrices, which fail to capture rich, dynamic relationships such as traffic similarity and strength, features embedded in time-varying data and challenging to model effectively. To comprehensively understand and leverage these inter-node relationships, we propose a unified framework: Pretrained Graph Transformer (PreGT) and Mix Graph Transformer (MixGT). PreGT, through self-supervised masking and reconstruction of nodes, learns latent representations of inter-node relationships from time-varying node features. MixGT integrates relationship matrix construction and utilization modules, effectively leveraging the latent representations from PreGT through graph convolution and attention mechanisms to enhance the model's ability to capture dynamic inter-node relationship features. Experimental validation on real traffic flow datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in predicting traffic flow by accurately capturing inter-node relationships. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - How to select a suitable spatial weighting scheme for convolutional graph neural networks (ConvGNNs) is challenging. In this study, we propose a ConvGNN, termed learnable graph convolutional (LGC) network, which learns spatial weightings between a road and its k-hop neighbours as learnable parameters in the spatial convolutional operator. A dynamic LGC (DLGC) network is further proposed to learn the dynamics of spatial weightings by explicitly considering the temporal correlations of spatial weightings at different times of the day. A multi-temporal DLGC (MTDLGC) network is developed for forecasting traffic variables in road networks. Results of case study suggest that the MT-DLGC network can achieve higher prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art baselines. Both LGC and DLGC networks can be used as general spatial weighting schemes for baselines with better forecasting performance than existing spatial weighting schemes, e.g., graph attention.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for understanding and managing congestion for efficient transportation planning. However, conventional approaches often neglect epistemic uncertainty, which arises from incomplete knowledge across different spatiotemporal scales. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a novel methodology to establish dynamic spatiotemporal correlations that captures the unobserved heterogeneity in travel time through distinct peaks in probability density functions, guided by physics-based principles. We propose an innovative approach to modifying both prediction and correction steps of the Kalman filter (KF) algorithm by leveraging established spatiotemporal correlations. Central to our approach is the development of a novel deep learning (DL) model called the physics informed-graph convolutional gated recurrent neural network (PI-GRNN). Functioning as the state-space model within the KF, the PI-GRNN exploits established correlations to construct dynamic adjacency matrices that utilize the inherent structure and relationships within the transportation network to capture sequential patterns and dependencies over time. Furthermore, our methodology integrates insights gained from correlations into the correction step of the KF algorithm that helps in enhancing its correctional capabilities. This integrated approach proves instrumental in alleviating the inherent model drift associated with data-driven methods, as periodic corrections through update step of KF refine the predictions generated by the PI-GRNN. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents a pioneering effort in integrating DL and KF algorithms in this unique symbiotic manner. Through extensive experimentation with real-world traffic data, we demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to the benchmark approaches. © 2025 Tongji University and Tongji University Press

AB  - Predicting traffic speed is an important issue, especially in urban regions. Precise long-term forecasts would enable individuals to conserve time and financial resources while diminishing air pollution. Despite extensive research on this subject, to our knowledge, no publications investigate or tackle the issue of imbalanced datasets in traffic speed prediction. Traffic speed data are often biased toward high numbers because low traffic speeds are infrequent. The temporal aspect of traffic carries two important factors for low-speed value. The daily population movement, captured by the time of day, and the weather data, recorded by month, are both considered in this study. Hour-wise Pattern Organization and Month-wise Pattern Organization techniques were devised, which organize the speed data using these two factors as a metric with a view to providing a superior representation of data characteristics that are in the minority. In addition to these two methods, a Speed-wise Pattern Organization strategy is proposed, which arranges train and test samples by setting boundaries on speed while taking the volatile nature of traffic into consideration. We evaluated these strategies using four popular model types: long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit networks (GRUs), bi-directional LSTM, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). GRU had the best performance, achieving a MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of 13.51%, whereas LSTM demonstrated the lowest performance, with a MAPE of 13.74%. We validated their robustness through our studies and observed improvements in model accuracy across all categories. While the average improvement was approximately 4%, our methodologies demonstrated superior performance in low-traffic speed scenarios, augmenting model prediction accuracy by 11.2%. The presented methodologies in this study are applied in the pre-processing steps, allowing their application with various models and additional pre-processing procedures to attain comparable performance improvements. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - In intelligent transportation, federated learning has garnered significant attention for its privacy protection and model optimization capabilities. However, existing approaches still struggle with high computational and communication costs. Moreover, challenges such as the uneven distribution of traffic nodes and time sequences, global dynamic spatio-temporal correlation, and security concerns in the spatio-temporal modeling process remain insufficiently addressed in distributed transportation research. To tackle these challenges, this study proposed a Privacy-Preserving Dynamic Spatio-temporal Graph Data Federated Split Learning (PPSTSL) method. By incorporating a split learning framework for spatio-temporal modeling under privacy protection, PPSTSL enables the integration of multi-client data to enhance global model performance while mitigating computational and communication overhead. Specifically, we present Federated Distribution-Aligned Temporal Dependency Modeling (FedDATDep) to optimize the model parameters and enrich temporal features. Additionally, we design Federated Spatio-Temporal Fusion (FedTSFus) to achieve global dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies while preserving privacy. Furthermore, we propose a Positive-Negative Coupled Coding (PNCC) mechanism to enhance the computational and communication efficiency of the introduced security techniques. Experimental results show that PPSTSL achieves superior model performance in both independent and non-independent identical distribution scenarios (IID and Non-IID) on the SZ-Taxi and Los-Loop traffic datasets, while demonstrating strong scalability. Furthermore, the optimized security techniques not only enhance privacy protection but also reduce communication and computational overhead. The proposed PPSTSL approach addresses crucial limitations in existing distributed research methods in intelligent transportation, presenting a promising direction for future research and practical implementations. © 2025

AB  - The growing implementation of autonomous cars in intelligent transportation systems requires solid traffic forecasting and incident prevention mechanisms. Yet, there are difficulties in attaining system interoperability and user acceptability. In this research, a deep learning-based framework is suggested for traffic forecasting and prevention based on the use of a forensic method on autonomous car data. A restricted boltzmann machine derives deep, weighted features which are subsequently handled by an adaptive dilated long short-term memory model optimized by using the position updated osprey optimization algorithm. Forecasted traffic data are analyzed further to formulate mitigation strategies such as optimized path planning. Experimental results demonstrate better performance compared to the baseline methods based on various metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of the framework in improving future transportation systems and autonomous vehicle forensics. © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays a critical role in tasks such as route planning and traffic management. Recent advancements in graph neural networks have enabled the effective modeling of spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing traffic prediction accuracy. However, most existing research primarily focuses on general spatiotemporal characteristics shared across all nodes, often neglecting the unique attributes of individual nodes. Additionally, these studies tend to overlook the diverse temporal features inherent in the data, limiting their ability to fully capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces the Spatiotemporal Interactive Learning Dynamic Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (SILDAGCN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, SILDAGCN incorporates a data embedding module to integrate temporal features into the raw data and extract critical information effectively. Moreover, it employs a dynamic adaptive graph convolutional network designed to capture real-time spatiotemporal dynamics and uncover both shared and node-specific spatiotemporal correlations. This paper also introduces a spatiotemporal feature interaction learning mechanism designed to capture and learn the diverse, evolving characteristics of spatiotemporal dependencies, enabling mutual enhancement through effective feedback. Finally, the output block leverages convolutional operations to enhance the model's information extraction capabilities, producing the final traffic network forecasts. Experimental evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SILDAGCN achieves accurate traffic flow and demand predictions with relatively low computational cost. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the aviation industry, highlighting the critical need for accurate airport traffic predictions. This study compares the performance of BiGRU and CNN-BiGRU models to enhance airport traffic forecasting accuracy models from March to December 2020. Data preprocessing was performed using Python's Pandas library. This involved filtering, scaling using min-max normalization, and splitting the data into 80:20 training-testing split using Python's Pandas library. Various optimization techniques— RMSProp, Adam, Nadam, Adamax, AdamW, and Lion—were applied, along with ReduceLROnPlateau, to optimize model performance. The models were evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The best predictive performance was observed in the United States using the CNN-BiGRU model with the Adam optimizer, achieving the lowest MAE of 0.0580, MSE of 0.0097, and MAPE of 0.0979. The use of a balanced dataset, representing each airport's traffic as a percentage of a baseline period, significantly improved prediction accuracy. This research provides valuable insights for stakeholders seeking effective airport traffic prediction methods during unprecedented times. © 2025, Department of Informatics, UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung, Indonesia.

AB  - Within the realm of intelligent transportation systems, the precise forecasting of vehicular speed across individual road segments constitutes a fundamental task. This metric serves as a pivotal indicator for evaluating the extent of network congestion and facilitating informed strategic planning. Contemporary methodologies predominantly employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model temporal dependencies, while leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture spatial dependencies within the data. However, these methods fail to integrate temporal and spatial dependencies to establish global dependencies. This study introduces the spatio-temporal kernel graph convolutional network (STK-GCN), a novel framework designed for modeling and forecasting traffic data. Specifically, we devise a spatio-temporal kernel capable of generating both spatial and temporal matrices, which are subsequently utilized within a encoder–decoder architecture to concurrently capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a novel temporal graph convolution module to enhance temporal data. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed STK-GCN, comprehensive experiments were carried out on two real-world traffic datasets, namely METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. The results indicate that our model surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. © 2025 by the author.

AB  - Mobile data traffic has skyrocketed due to the cellular technologies’ rapid growth. Creating precise time-series models is crucial for 5G cellular networks in particular, as it helps to forecast and enhance mobile data traffic and quality of service (QoS). The models for predicting mobile data traffic enable network operators to better manage resources and enhance user experience while responding to traffic needs. Consequently, a number of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been created for the prediction of mobile data traffic. However, the current models are unable to adequately characterize the features. To overcome these issues, an optimized deep learning approach and blockchain strategy are designed for predicting traffic prediction and improving security in cellular networks. The input raw LTE network dataset is initially pre-processed to achieve high accuracy. Regression imputation is utilized as a pre-processing technique for missing value imputation. The processed images are then fed into the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) based feature extraction approach for extracting features from an image. These extracted features are then provided to the Elman Neural Network (ElmanNet) classifier, which predicts cellular traffic in the network. Lastly, the connection between the access point and user equipment is secured by the Blockchain-radio access network (B-RAN). 94.2 % is the accuracy attained by this approach and it also has a block creation time of 12 sec. Therefore, the proposed model is the greatest option for efficient traffic forecasting and cellular network security improvement. © 2025

AB  - Traffic forecasting is an enduring research topic in the design of intelligent transportation systems and spatial-temporal data mining. Accurate prediction can help facilitate urban resource optimization and improve road efficiency. However, the complex spatial-temporal dependencies and dynamic urban conditions make it extremely challenging. Although many spatial-temporal modeling approaches have been proposed recently, they still suffer from the following three problems: (1) Inadequate modeling of temporal correlations; (2) Ignoring the fundamental fact that the location dependence of road networks changes dynamically over time; (3) Difficulty in extracting deeper spatial-temporal features layer by layer. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Attention-enhanced Network called DSTAN for traffic prediction. In DSTAN, we combine gated temporal units with trend-aware multi-head temporal attention to jointly capture local and long-range temporal dependencies. We also employ learnable node embeddings to extract heterogeneous information and integrate this with the spatial attention module to learn dynamic spatial correlations without any expert knowledge. Structurally, we stack multiple spatial-temporal blocks to improve the model’s capability to identify complex patterns. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four widely used datasets, demonstrating that our method surpasses all baseline methods while exhibiting strong interpretability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - For distributed network traffic prediction with data localization and privacy protection, Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data exchange across Base Stations (BSs). Nevertheless, traffic across BSs exhibit inherently heterogeneous trend burst and smooth fluctuation properties, but existing FL methods model single-scale series from only one view, which cannot simultaneously capture diverse trend and fluctuation properties, especially distinct burst distributions. In this paper, we propose Personalized Federated Forecasting with Multi-property Self-fusion (P2FMS), which can represent multi-scale traffic properties from different views. With precise multi-property representations, a fusion-level prediction decision is learned for each client in a personalized manner to promptly sense traffic bursts and improve forecasting performance in non-IID settings. Specifically, P2FMS decomposes the traffic series into distinct time scales, based on which, we effectively extract closeness, period, and trend properties from different views. The closeness and period are embedded through global-view representations with spatial correlations, while non-stationary trends are individually fitted from the client-side view. Furthermore, a personalized combiner is designed to accurately quantify the proportion of general fluctuation raws (i.e., closeness and period) and specific trend property in predictions, which enables multi-property self-fusion for each client to accommodate heterogeneous traffic patterns and enhance prediction accuracy. Besides, an alternant training mechanism is introduced to optimize property representation and fusion modules with the convergence guarantee. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that P2FMS outperforms status quo methods in both prediction performance and convergence time.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic flow prediction is crucial for urban traffic control, route planning, and congestion detection. However, traffic data is influenced by spatial-temporal relationships and exhibits significant distribution drifts. This phenomenon can be attributed to volatile events in the traffic network, which make periodic trends ambiguous and difficult to learn. Consequently, traffic signals can be seen as a combination of fluctuating event signals and stable trend signals, both possessing rich and distinct spatial-temporal characteristics. Although recent methods have achieved considerable performance, most of them still roughly treat the traffic flow as a whole without considering the interactions between trend and event factors from a decoupled perspective. To address this issue, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Trend-Event Decoupling Dual-Channel Framework (TEDDCF) for traffic forecasting. TEDDCF first decomposes traffic flow into trend and event signals, and constructs a Dual-Channel Signal Encoder (DCSE) to model each signal independently. Temporally, DCSE uses multi-head attention and causal convolution to learn long-term trends and short-term event features. Spatially, we design two novel dynamic fusion graph convolutional modules-Trend-GCN and Event-GCN-to capture the independent spatial characteristics of each signal. In the decoder, the complete spatial-temporal representation of traffic flow is obtained through a Trend-Event Interactive Fusion (TEIF) module for prediction. Experiments on six traffic datasets show that TEDDCF outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

AB  - The graph-based traffic forecasting is generally realized on the assumption of sufficient data, which could be impractical in the regions without well-deployed mobile sensors or data-processing facilities. Recent studies have developed a solution with the cross-region transfer learning, i.e. transferring traffic knowledge from the source regions to target ones, whose traffic data and computing resources are limited. Nevertheless, relevant issues, including initialization selection and domain adaptation, have not been effectively tackled in the cross-region graph-based traffic forecasting. This paper proposes the cluster-granularity spatiotemporal transfer (CGSTT), which transfers the cluster-granularity knowledge from the source region to target one for the cross-region graph-based traffic forecasting, as not all source knowledge is positive to the target region. Additionally, the domain adaptation is achieved by the dual alignment consisting of the covariate alignment and label alignment of the source/target data, making the proposed CGSTT adapt to the target region efficiently. The superiority of the proposed method over ten compared baseline methods for both short-term and long-term predictions is demonstrated by the conducted experiments on four tasks, which show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving an 8.89% average improvement in forecasting accuracy. The PyTorch implementation of the CGSTT is available at https://github.com/canyangguo/CGSTT.  © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - This article proposes a robust decoupling network named RDNet to provide stable traffic predictions even when perturbations exist in historical data. A decoupling block is designed in the RDNet for dividing traffic data into the invariable component (IC) and variable component (VC). The IC of historical or future data is estimated through the invariable block without historical data and thus would not be perturbed. The variable block is developed to forecast the VC of future data using the VC of historical data. Besides, the robust graph neural network and smoothing loss are designed to reduce the effects of perturbations. The RDNet fuses the obtained IC and VC of future data to produce the predictions, and the invariable and decoupling losses are developed for stabilizing the prediction. The results on six open datasets have demonstrated that the RDNet can achieve a 15.62% average improvement in accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art predictor. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Urban traffic management has been facing increasing challenges due to the surge in number of vehicles and traffic congestion. As cities expand and population grows, efficient and accurate monitoring of vehicle counts is crucial for better traffic management. Hence, as part of the Bengaluru Mobility Challenge 2024, organized by Bengaluru Traffic Police in collaboration with The Indian Institute of Science, we propose a solution to address the issue by developing a predictive model to estimate vehicle counts by turning pattern from traffic video footage. The dataset consists of traffic video footage of 23 different junctions around Bengaluru, on which 7 vehicle classes had to be detected, namely, Car, Truck, Bus, Two-Wheeler, Three-Wheeler, Light Commercial Vehicle and Bicycle. The proposed work focuses on two key objectives: counting vehicle turns over 30-minute clips and forecasting future vehicle turn counts by class for the next 30 minutes. A You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) and Auto-ARIMA based pipeline was deployed to address the challenge, which demonstrated robust detection capabilities, with an overall precision of 92.59% for vehicle detection. Building on this, we designed a custom vehicle counting algorithm that integrated the BoT-SORT tracker with dynamic counting boxes, accurately capturing vehicle movements and turn patterns in real-time and this integrated approach attained a best deviation of 20.79%. for turn pattern counting and 28.41% for forecasting. Furthermore, the system is scalable to accommodate any number of cameras and is capable of forecasting traffic over extended time frames, allowing it to be applied to a variety of urban traffic monitoring scenarios. These results highlight the effectiveness of our custom designed framework in real-world scenarios as a reliable model for applications needing high-precision detection and predictive analytics. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, transformer-based learning models have shown promising results in network traffic prediction across various contexts. However, their potential in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environments remains largely unexplored, despite the unique requirements of MEC such as low latency and high-bandwidth communication between end-users and edge servers. This study evaluates the performance of four transformer-based learning models for Internet traffic prediction in MEC environments, comparing them against state-of-the-art models using a real-world dataset from publicly available mobile operator networks. Performance is assessed using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed GAN-based transformer model, referred to as 5GT-GAN-Trans, achieves an MSE of 0.428 and an MAE of 0.441, considerably outperforming baseline models such as FED-Former-F (MSE: 0.791, MAE: 0.606), FED-Former-W (MSE: 0.622, MAE: 0.508), Informer (MSE: 0.814, MAE: 0.649), and a standard Transformer model (MSE: 0.803, MAE: 0.640). These numerical improvements underscore the efficacy of transformer-based models for precise Internet traffic forecasting in MEC environments, offering valuable insights for improved network management and enhanced user experience. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of the information technology era, accurate ride-hailing demand forecasting can facilitate the pre-scheduling of car routes, optimize vehicle utilization, and alleviate urban peak congestion as information technology advances quickly. Even though many specialists have undertaken research in this area, traditional prediction models seldom use historical data and rarely use multi-step prediction since traffic forecasting involves the influence of many variables, including time and geography. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient multi-step prediction model (PSA-DM, ProbSparse Self-Attention Distribute Model) for accurate multi-step prediction based on historical request data. In the model, which uses an encoder–decoder framework with long-sequence output prediction. The temporal correlation of the input data is first extracted through the embedding layer, and the correlation between regions is extracted using graph attention networks. To achieve the multi-step prediction effect, the decoder then passes the prediction results back to the encoder for weight distribution and fusion. This allows for further exploration of the complicated spatiotemporal correlation between historical and future information as well as the realization of efficient multi-step prediction. We employed three actual ride-hailing datasets, applied the model to determine the spatial similarity between the data, and tested the projected data for use as the subsequent prediction data. The model performed better than the majority of the baseline models and correctly represented the ride-hailing demand issue according to the data. As a result, the transportation sector has a strong theoretical basis for vehicle scheduling. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Short-term traffic flow forecasting is an essential part of intelligent transportation systems. However, it is challenging to model traffic flow accurately due to its rapid changes over time. The Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) has shown parameter efficiency with lower memory and computational overhead via spline-parametrized functions to handle high-dimensional temporal data. In this paper, we propose to unlock the potential of the Kolmogorov–Arnold network for traffic flow forecasting by optimizing its parameters with a heuristic algorithm. The gravitational search algorithm learns to understand optimized KANs for different traffic scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The RMSE of GSA-KAN is reduced by (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.), and the MAPE of GSA-KAN is reduced by (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.) on the A1, A2, A4, and A8 datasets, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that GSA-KAN performs advanced parametric and nonparametric models. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Mobile energy storage systems (MESSs) possess significant temporal and spatial flexibility, making them ideal for ancillary services in active distribution networks (ADNs). However, conventional MESS scheduling methods rely heavily on accurate load and traffic forecasts, while deep learning-based approaches can be computationally expensive and insufficiently adaptive to dynamic system conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage scheduling framework that integrates sensitivity analysis, graph theory, and dynamic optimization techniques, thereby enhancing adaptability and computational efficiency. In the first stage, a destination pre-generation model leverages probabilistic voltage sensitivity to accommodate load forecast uncertainties and pinpoint critical ADN nodes that are most likely to require ancillary support. In the second stage, an innovative destination screening algorithm based on Hall's theorem refines the candidate nodes, coupled with a dynamic rolling optimization scheme that continuously updates MESS routes and charging/discharging strategies in real-time. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our proposed two-stage framework improves scheduling accuracy by 5.56 %, boosts the mission finish rate by 35.27 %, and extends the average hourly duration of ancillary services by roughly 20 min. These results underscore the framework's effectiveness and adaptability, offering a robust solution for reliable ADN operations. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting plays a crucial role in applications such as intelligent transportation systems. Despite significant research in this field, the current methods have limitations that hinder the realization of highly accurate predictions. Existing GCN-based approaches typically rely on a definite graph structure derived from a physical topology or learned from node features, which is insufficient for building intricate spatial relationships among nodes. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive spatial–temporal graph convolutional network for traffic forecasting. Our approach exploits a multi-head attention mechanism to construct multi-view feature graphs. We then introduce an adaptive graph convolution method to dynamically aggregate and propagate information from both the topology graph and multi-view feature graphs, which are capable of capturing complex spatial correlations across diverse proximity ranges. Furthermore, we designed a cascaded structural framework that combines temporal information with node features using gated dilated causal convolution to ensure the integrated modeling of spatial–temporal dynamics in traffic flow. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the current mainstream methods, achieving better performance in traffic flow forecasting.

AB  - Proactive traffic management is increasingly critical in maritime intelligent transportation systems. Central to this is maritime traffic forecasting, which leverages specific structures and properties of the problem. This study focuses on the traffic dynamics within convergent areas of inland waterways and proposes a method based on data mining followed by prediction using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. This approach addresses uncertainties in ship voyage destinations and optimizes predictions for temporary stops in inland waterways. AIS data is processed to depict complete ship motion trajectories, grouping them into trajectory sets based on shared origin, destination, and route. These groups help represent maritime traffic patterns using the entrance and exit points of channels and the boundaries of the study area. Additionally, a stop detection model is applied to these trajectories to identify nodes within maritime traffic networks. A decision tree algorithm is then employed to train a classifier for predicting traffic patterns. The method was validated in the convergent area of the Yangtze River and the Hanjiang River, demonstrating effective pattern extraction from inland maritime traffic and high accuracy in predicting single ship trajectories, achieving a 96.7% accuracy rate and 80.9% precision. The findings suggest that the proposed method (1) effectively extracts and predicts traffic patterns, (2) identifies congestion in convergent waters, and (3) supports traffic management strategies. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Exploiting spatial–temporal correlations has long been regarded as the cornerstone of traffic state prediction. Among existing techniques, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have recently emerged as a prominent solution for modeling complex spatial–temporal traffic data correlations. Existing studies on TGNNs mainly focus on developing new building blocks to embed hidden correlations into a unified latent representation, which is mapped to predictions of distinct horizons. However, mapping the same latent features to distinct scalar predictions makes the gradient computation challenging for updating model parameters in the relevant directions. Besides, TGNNs are biased towards the shared temporal patterns while neglecting the complex dependencies within each data series, which can be captured to enrich latent features. To handle these problems jointly, we propose a novel feature projection scheme for the traffic prediction framework of TGNNs. The proposed projection scheme is based on spatial convolutions that first generate horizon-specific feature maps and then transform them into scalar predictions of the corresponding horizons. These horizon-specific feature maps establish interactions between the unified latent representation and the corresponding output values to bring the predictions closer to the true values. Besides, the proposed scheme also serves as a pattern modeling phase that enhances the expressivity of TGNNs by enriching latent features with data source-wise patterns of distinct time steps. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme enhances the predictive performance and reduces the model parameters of TGNNs. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The development and progress in sensor, communication, and computing technologies have led to smart environments. In such environments, data can easily be acquired not only from the monitored entities but also from the surroundings where the entity is operating. The data from the operating environment, which is not useful for learning models in isolation, is referred to as explicit context here. The performance of the predictive models can potentially improve when explicit contexts are taken into account. Typically, the data from various sensors are present in the form of time series. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used for such data as they implicitly can deal with temporal contexts. However, while using RNNs for various smart environment applications, the available explicit contexts are often ignored or incorporated as primary (or ordinary) features into the model. Further, the conventional RNN models such as Elman RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) in their current form do not provide any mechanism to integrate explicit contexts. In this paper, we propose a Context Integrated RNN (CiRNN) that enables integrating explicit contexts represented in the form of contextual features. In CiRNN, the network weights are influenced by contextual features in such a way that the primary input features receive more weight if they are relevant in a given context. To show the efficacy of CiRNN, we selected three application domains, remaining useful life estimation for predictive maintenance, traffic forecasting for intelligent transportation systems, and appliance energy usage prediction for smart homes. These applications typically capture data from various sensors and provide scope for exploiting contextual information. For all three case studies, we used public datasets. The test results show that CiRNN performs better when compared to baseline models that incorporate contextual features as primary features, as well as in comparison to state-of-the-art models. The performance is measured in terms of RMSE, MAE, and score from an asymmetric scoring function. The latter measure is specific to the task of RUL estimation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents an intelligent dynamic network optimization system for packet-optical transport networks as the industry moves towards 6G. Such a system leverages specific artificial intelligence techniques to dynamically manage the transport network, optimize resource allocation, and guarantee quality of services. A predictive and adaptive Markov decision process is defined by exploiting an ad hoc model of optical-packet nodes and network representation used for the environment description. Comparison of statistical and neural network-based approaches is done for traffic forecasting. QL, DQL, and PPO are compared to solve the reinforcement learning problem. Challenges and opportunities of applying this system in various scenarios are discussed, and assessment is done by simulations that showed advantages in the following aspects: minimization of bandwidth usage guaranteeing quality of services with respect to a conventional system, improvement of optical offload improvement to reduce power consumption and packet processing, and efficient load balancing.  © 2009-2012 Optica Publishing Group.

AB  - Traffic-state forecasting is crucial for traffic management and control strategies, as well as user- and system-level decision-making in the transportation network. While traffic forecasting has been approached with a variety of techniques over the last couple of decades, most approaches simply rely on endogenous traffic variables for state prediction, despite the evidence that exogenous factors can significantly affect traffic conditions. This paper proposes a multidimensional spatiotemporal graph attention-based traffic-prediction approach (M-STGAT), which predicts traffic based on past observations of speed, along with lane-closure events, temperature, and visibility across a large transportation network. The approach is based on a graph attention network architecture, which learns based on the structure of the transportation network on which these variables are observed. Numerical experiments are performed using traffic-speed and lane-closure data from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) and corresponding weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOOA) Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS). The numerical experiments implement three alternative models which do not allow for multidimensional input, along with two alternative multidimensional models, based on the literature. The M-STGAT outperforms the five alternative models in validation and testing with the primary data set, as well as for one transfer data set across all three prediction horizons for all error measures. However, the model’s transferability varies for the remaining two transfer data sets, which may require further investigation. The results demonstrate that M-STGAT has the most consistently low error values across all transfer data sets and prediction horizons. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies and temporal patterns in traffic series are critical factors affecting traffic forecasting accuracy. Due to the intrinsic challenges of incorporating explicit, logical knowledge into the implicit black-box learning process of neural networks, only a few methods effectively use prior knowledge to improve the learning of traffic forecasting. To tackle this problem, we introduce a new approach called Knowledge-augmented and Time-aware Graph Convolutional Network, namely KaTaGCN. At its core, we have created a knowledge-augmented module that boosts the diffusion weights between closely related adjacent nodes in graph learning. This is achieved by implementing a new loss function. Then, to learn the periodic implicit relationship between these timestamps and traffic signals, the weights and biases are chosen adaptively to be trained based on the timestamps of each sample. Finally, a gated spatio-temporal mapping module regresses high-dimensional embedded features from spatial and temporal dimensions. KaTaGCN is structured without any attention mechanisms or recurrent neural networks. Extensive experimental results on six real-world public traffic datasets demonstrate that KaTaGCN achieves an average improvement of 4.29% in forecasting performance compared with suboptimal results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a crucial task of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), which remains very challenging as it is affected by the complexity and depth of the road network. Although the decision-makers focus on the accuracy of the top-level roads, the forecasts on the lower levels also improve the overall performance of ITS. In such a situation, a hierarchical forecasting strategy is more appropriate as well as a more accurate prediction methods to reach an efficient forecast. In this paper, we present a deep learning (DL) approach for hierarchical forecasting of traffic flow by exploring the hierarchical structure of the road network. The proposed approach is considered an improved variation on the top-down strategy for the reconciliation process. We propose a model based on two deep neural network components to generate a coherent forecast for the total number of road segments. We use N-BEATS, a pure deep learning forecasting method, at the highest levels for traffic time series, then disaggregate these downwards to get coherent forecasts for each series of the hierarchy using a combination of CNN and LSTM. Experiments were carried out using Beijing road traffic dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The cinematic metaverse aims to create a virtual space with the context of a film. Users can enter this space in the form of avatars, experiencing the cinematic plot firsthand in an immersive manner. This requires us to design a rational computation resource allocation and synchronization algorithm to meet the demands of multi-objective joint optimization, such as low latency and high throughput, which ensures that users can seamlessly switch between virtual and real worlds and acquire immersive experiences. Unfortunately, the explosive growth in the number of users makes it difficult to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Predicting traffic generated by the users' avatars in the cinematic metaverse is significant for the optimization process. Although graph neural networks-based traffic prediction models achieve superior prediction accuracy, these methods rely only on physical distances-based topological graph information, while failing to comprehensively reflect the real relationships between avatars in the cinematic metaverse. To address this issue, we present a novel Multi-Graph Representation Spatio-Temporal Attention Networks (MGRSTANet) for traffic prediction in the cinematic metaverse. Specifically, based on multiple topological graph information (e.g., physical distances, centerity, and similarity), we first design Multi-Graph Embedding (MGE) module to generate multiple graph representations, thus reflecting on the real relationships between avatars more comprehensively. The Spatio-Temporal Attention (STAtt) module is then proposed to extract spatio-temporal correlations in each graph representations, thus improving prediction accuracy. We conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MGRSTANet. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy, making it appropriate for traffic forecasting in the cinematic metaverse. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to enhance the understanding of vehicle path selection behavior within arterial road networks by investigating the influencing factors and analyzing spatial and temporal traffic flow distributions. Using radio frequency identification (RFID) travel data, key factors such as travel duration, route familiarity, route length, expressway ratio, arterial road ratio, and ramp ratio were identified. We then proposed an origin–destination path acquisition method and developed a route-selection prediction model based on a multinomial logit model with sample weights. Additionally, the study linked the traffic control scheme with travel time using the Bureau of Public Roads function—a model that illustrates the relationship between network-wide travel time and traffic demand—and developed an arterial road network traffic forecasting model. Verification showed that the prediction accuracy of the improved multinomial logit model increased from 92.55 % to 97.87 %. Furthermore, reducing the green time ratio for multilane merging from 0.75 to 0.5 significantly decreased the likelihood of vehicles choosing this route and reduced the number of vehicles passing through the ramp. The flow prediction model achieved a 97.9 % accuracy, accurately reflecting actual volume changes and ensuring smooth operation of the main airport road. This provides a strong foundation for developing effective traffic control plans. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Traffic information can reflect the operating status of a city, and accurate traffic forecasting is critical in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and urban planning. However, traffic information has complex nonlinearity and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies due to human mobility, bringing new traffic forecasting challenges. This paper proposed a graph spatial-temporal transformer network for traffic prediction (GSTTN) to cope with the above problems. Specifically, the proposed framework explores spatial characteristics of the across-road network of traffic information hidden in human behavior patterns via a multi-view graph convolutional network (GCN). Furthermore, the transformer network with a multi-head attention mechanism is adopted to capture the random disturbance in the time series characteristics of traffic information. As a result, these two components can be used to model spatial relations and temporal trends. Finally, we examine real-world datasets, and the experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art baselines. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Spatio-temporal time series forecasting has attracted great attention in various fields, including climate, power, and traffic forecasting. Recently, Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have shown promising performance in modeling spatial dependencies based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and temporal dependencies based on temporal learning modules. However, most STGNNs do not effectively integrate explicit and implicit relationships between nodes, nor do they adequately capture long and short-term time dependencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Quaternion Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network(QSTGNN). Specifically, the quaternion spatio-temporal graph is constructed firstly, such that the information of both short and long-term time steps are preserved in quaternion feature tensor, and information of multiple explicit graphs and implicit graph are integrated in quaternion graph adjacency matrix. Then, two modules are designed: a 1D quaternion convolution module and a quaternion graph convolution module. In the 1D quaternion convolution module, complex temporal correlations among short and long-term time steps can be well exploited by 1D quaternion convolution operator based on the quaternion Hamilton product. In the quaternion graph convolution module, quaternion graph convolution is designed to characterize nonlinear dependencies among multiple spatial graphs, including explicit and implicit graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on six datasets, and the results show that QSTGNN achieves state-of-the-art performances over the existing ten methods. Explainable analysis presents that multiple spatial correlations can accurately illustrate the traffic flow and road functional information in real traffic roads. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Efficient traffic management and congestion-aware routing are one of the main challenges in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). In smart city ecosystems, there is a greater need for proper traffic management so that transportation is efficient, the rate of congestion is minimized, and road safety is improved. VANET enables vehicle to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, and it is expected to be used as a potential platform for dynamic traffic management in the near future. Traditional routing methods, including static protocols or simplistic predictive models, have several limitations. These methods are usually unable to adapt to the changing traffic conditions that occur very rapidly, thus causing inefficient routing, increased congestion, and reduced communication reliability. To overcome these shortcomings, the study proposes a hybrid AI-driven framework, TrafNet: Temporal Driven Adaptive Traffic Intelligence (TCN-DQN), which integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). The TCN will identify congestion trends by predicting the outcome using sequential data relevant to traffic, hence long-term traffic forecasting. At the same time, the DQN employs real-time traffic conditions to learn adaptive routing policies in real time. This is further achieved with the load balancing and multi-channel communication for more reliable communication with the aid of a Dynamic Congestion-Aware Multi-Channel Routing Protocol (DCMCRP). The proposed system achieves a MAE of 0.01 and a RMSE of 0.02 and significantly outperforms existing approaches. This integration ensures proactive and smart routing of the vehicle, taking care of immediate responses and also of long-term predictions. © (2025), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

AB  - Due to the extensive implementation of the fifth generation wireless communication networks (5 G), numerous base stations are being strategically deployed in densely inhabited areas to address the escalating need for network traffic. Within wireless cellular networks, over 80% of energy consumption is primarily concentrated on the side of the base station. In comparison to 4 G base stations, the 5 G base stations exhibit notable enhancements in terms of bandwidth, peak rate, and transmission power. Nonetheless, they suffer from limited signal coverage and extensive resource consumption. To address this challenge effectively, the present study introduces a Mobile Perception Dual-Level (MPDL) base station sleep control strategy based on cellular traffic forecasting. The strategy aims to satisfy the demands for reduced power consumption and enhanced service quality by monitoring both the current network traffic of the base station and the user's mobility, consequently placing the base station into two different sleep states. Specifically, we first designed an inverted Transformer (iTransformer) model to accurately forecast cellular traffic. The model is capable of effectively capturing both the spatial and temporal attributes of cellular traffic. It also takes into account the impact of geographical features, such as Points of Interest (POIs) and the quantity of Base Stations (BSs), on the forecasting outcomes. Consequently, it attains precise predictions of the cellular traffic. Based on the forecasting outcomes of cellular traffic, this study presents a mobility perception dual-level sleep strategy. This strategy proposal differentiates sleep into deep sleep and light sleep, while also taking into account the mobility attributes of users. It incorporates considerations for Quality of Service (QoS) and energy consumption. We assess the performance and application impacts of cellular traffic forecasting and base station sleep strategy in real-world datasets. Several experiments and validations have confirmed that the MPDL, as proposed in this paper, effectively decreases power consumption by a range of 22% to 41% when compared to baselines. © 2024

AB  - Advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially enhanced Vehicular Networks (VNs) across primary domains, encompassing traffic forecasting and management, route optimization and algorithmic planning, and cooperative driving. Despite the boosts of the GNN for VNs, recent research has empirically demonstrated its potential vulnerability to backdoor attacks, wherein adversaries integrate triggers into inputs to manipulate GNNs to generate adversary-premeditated malicious outputs (e.g., misclassification of vehicle actions or traffic signals). This susceptibility is attributable to adversarial manipulation attacks targeting the training process of GNN-based VN systems. Although there is a rapid increase in research on GNN backdoors, systematic surveys within this domain remain lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first survey dedicated to GNN backdoors. We start with outlining the fundamental definition of GNNs, followed by the detailed summarization and categorization of current GNN backdoors and countermeasures based on their technical features and application scenarios. Subsequently, an analysis of the applicability paradigms of GNN backdoors is conducted, and prospective research trends are presented. Unlike prior surveys on vision-centric backdoors, we uniquely investigate GNN-oriented backdoor attacks in VNs, which aims to explore attack surfaces across spatiotemporal vehicular graphs and provide insights to security research. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a challenging issue in the transportation field due to its high nonlinearity and complexity. The key to extract valuable information from traffic data is to characterize the spatial and temporal correlations in a proper way, but it is difficult to achieve accurate quantification on these correlations, especially the spatial ones. Since road network in reality follows non-Euclidean geometry, graph convolution network (GCN), a semisupervised neural network for non-Euclidean graph modeling, has widely been applied in traffic forecasting to capture the spatial correlation of traffic flow. However, most of these GCN-based methods use a single definition on spatial correlation, which cannot precisely reflect the complicated association of road network. Meanwhile, the traditional form of graph convolution is the aggregation of neighboring nodes information, which is equal to a smoothing operation. When this operation repeats, the original data gets smoother, and that may lead to oversmoothing problem and the loss of some important characteristics of data. In response to these issues, a novel multiscale graph convolution method is proposed, in which three representations of the spatial structure of road network are defined and integrated through the multihead attention mechanism. Meanwhile, to avoid oversmoothing, the calculation of graph convolution is redefined to fuse the results of graphs with different scales of convolution by trainable adjustment factors. The proposed method is verified by experiments from different aspects. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, primarily through techniques applied to data in Euclidean spaces. However, many real world applications involve data from non-Euclidean domains, where graphs naturally represent entities and their complex interdependencies. Traditional machine learning methods have often struggled to process such data in an effective manner. Graph Neural Networks represent a crucial advance in the use of deep learning to interpret and extract knowledge from graph-based data. They have opened up new possibilities for tasks such as node categorization, link inference, and comprehensive graph analysis. This paper provides a detailed analysis of Graph Neural Network (GNN) methodologies, emphasizing their architectural diversity and wide ranging applications. GNN models are systematically categorized into fundamental frameworks such as message passing paradigms, spectral and spatial methods, and advanced extensions such as hypergraph neural networks and multigraph approaches. This paper also explores domains such as social network analysis, molecular biology, traffic forecasting, and recommendation systems. In addition, it emphasizes some critical open challenges, including scalability, dynamic graph modeling, and robustness against noisy or incomplete data. The paper concludes with a proposal for future research directions to improve the scalability, interpretability, and adaptability of GNNs in this fast-evolving field. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic data forecasting has become an integral part of the intelligent traffic system. Great efforts are spent developing tools and techniques to estimate traffic flow patterns. Many existing approaches lack the ability to model the complex and dynamic spatio-temporal relations in the traffic data, which are crucial in capturing the traffic dynamic. In this work, we propose AJSTGL, a novel adaptive joint spatio-temporal graph learning network for traffic data forecasting. The proposed model utilizes static and adaptive graph learning modules to capture the static and dynamic spatial traffic patterns and optimize the graph learning process. A sequence-to-sequence fusion model is proposed to learn the temporal correlation and combine the output of multiple parallelized encoders. We also develop a spatio-temporal graph transformer module to complement the sequence-to-sequence fusion module by dynamically capturing the time-evolving node relations in long-term intervals. Experiments on three large-scale traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our model could outperform other state-of-the-art baseline methods. © 2024 held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Traffic prediction is an essential task in intelligent transportation systems dealing with complex and dynamic spatio-temporal correlations. To date, most work is focused on point estimation models, which only output a single value w.r.t an attribute of traffic data at a time, falling short of depicting diverse situations and uncertainty in future. Besides, most methods are not flexible enough to handle real complex traffic scenarios, involving missing values and non-uniformly sampled data. The interactions among different attributes of traffic data are also rarely explored explicitly. In this paper, we focus on probabilistic estimation in traffic prediction tasks, proposing a spatio-temporal multivariate probabilistic predictive model to estimate the distributions of traffic data. Specifically, we devise a multivariate spatio-temporal fusion graph block to extract spatio-temporal correlations of multiple traffic attributes at different locations. A multi-graph fusion module is designed to capture time-varying spatial relationships. We estimate the joint distributions of missing traffic data using copulas. The proposed model can simultaneously perform traffic forecasting and interpolation tasks with non-uniformly sampled data. Our experiments on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate the advantages of our model over the state-of-the-art1  © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Industrial IoT (IIoT) applications are widely used in multiple use cases to automate the industrial environment. Industry 4.0 presents challenges in numerous areas, including heterogeneous data, efficient data sensing and collection, real-time data processing, and higher request arrival rates, due to the massive amount of industrial data. Building a time-sensitive network that supports the voluminous and dynamic IoT traffic from heterogeneous applications is complex. Therefore, the authors provide insights into the challenges of industrial networks and propose a strategy for enhanced traffic management. An efficient multivariate forecasting model that adapts the Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis is employed for an SDN-based IIoT network. The proposed method considers multiple traffic flow parameters, such as packet sent and received, flow bytes sent and received, source rate, round trip time, jitter, packet arrival rate and flow duration to predict future flows. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively predict by contemplating every possible variation in the observed samples and predict average load, delay, inter-packet arrival rate and source sending rate with improved accuracy. The forecast results shows reduced error estimation when compared with existing methods with Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.64%, Mean Squared Error of 11.99, Root Mean Squared Error of 3.46 and Mean Absolute Error of 2.63. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Long-term and Large-scale Wireless Traffic Forecasting (LL-WTF) is pivotal for strategic network management and comprehensive planning on a macro scale. However, LL-WTF poses greater challenges than short-term ones due to the pronounced non-stationarity of extended wireless traffic and the vast number of nodes distributed at the city scale. To cope with this, we propose a Progressive Supervision method based on Label Decomposition (PSLD). Specifically, we first introduce a Random Subgraph Sampling (RSS) algorithm designed to sample a tractable subset from large-scale traffic data, thereby enabling efficient network training. Then, PSLD employs label decomposition to obtain multiple easy-to-learn components, which are learned progressively at shallow layers and combined at deep layers to effectively cope with the non-stationary problem raised by LL-WTF tasks. Finally, we compare the proposed method with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three large-scale WT datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PSLD significantly outperforms existing methods, with an average 2%, 4%, and 11% performance improvement on three WT datasets, respectively. In addition, we built an open source library for WT forecasting (WTFlib) to facilitate related research, which contains numerous SOTA methods and provides a strong benchmark.

AB  - The development of motoring and the ever-increasing traffic load on roads results in congestion and the collapse of traffic in weak places, which, due to their existing construction solution and traffic organization, cannot cover the current and forecasted requirements of carriers. The aim of this article is to present a proposal for a procedure of adjusting the organization of transport, based on our own research and scientific methods of traffic forecasting. The authors work with the hypothesis that there are possibilities of rebuilding weak points in the existing network of overland roads into transport hubs with a higher transport capacity that will cover the requirements of transporters. In this article, the authors emphasize that the basis of the search for an optimal solution to the change in traffic remains the development of calculation methods and consideration of the specific traffic conditions occurring in the given country. Using the example of a case study within the Slovak Republic, we present a proposal for calculation methods based on European standards, which can be used practically without changes in every EU member country. This case study deals with the proposal to transform an uncontrolled four-way intersection into a roundabout. The authors carried out extensive transport research, and on the basis of data analysis, proposed construction and traffic-operational modifications of the existing junction in order to fulfil customer requirements in transport logistics. The proposed solution was verified alternatively with regard to the planned construction of a motorway section near the assessed intersection. When designing the calculation methods, we used our own experimental measurements directly in the area and also included in the calculation methods calculations regarding the capacity of turbo intersections, which are not yet addressed by the technical regulations in the SR environment. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting with high precision aids Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in formulating and optimizing traffic management strategies. The algorithms used for tuning the hyperparameters of the deep learning models often have accurate results at the expense of high computational complexity. To address this problem, this paper uses the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to tune the hyperparameters of the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) deep learning framework. The Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) uses a probabilistic approach with an adaptive searching mechanism by classifying the objective function values into good and bad samples. This ensures fast convergence in tuning the hyperparameter values in the deep learning model for performing prediction while still maintaining a certain degree of accuracy. It also overcomes the problem of converging to local optima and avoids time-consuming random search and, therefore, avoids high computational complexity in prediction accuracy. The proposed scheme first performs data smoothing and normalization on the input data, which is then fed to the input of the TPE for tuning the hyperparameters. The traffic data is then input to the LSTM model with tuned parameters to perform the traffic prediction. The three optimizers: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and Stochastic Gradient Descend with Momentum (SGDM) are also evaluated for accuracy prediction and the best optimizer is then chosen for final traffic prediction in TPE-LSTM model. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of accuracy of prediction over the benchmark schemes. Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

AB  - Building a real-time spatio-temporal forecasting system is a challenging problem with many practical applications such as traffic and road network management. Most forecasting research focuses on achieving (often marginal) improvements in evaluation metrics such as MAE/MAPE on static benchmark datasets, with less attention paid to building practical pipelines which achieve timely and accurate forecasts when the network is under heavy load. Transport authorities also need to leverage dynamic data sources such as roadworks and vehicle-level flow data, while also supporting ad-hoc inference workloads at low cost. Our cloud-based forecasting solution Foresight, developed in collaboration with Transport for the West Midlands (TfWM), is able to ingest, aggregate and process streamed traffic data, enhanced with dynamic vehicle-level flow and urban event information, to produce regularly scheduled forecasts with high accuracy. In this work, we extend Foresight with several novel enhancements, into a new system which we term Foresight Plus. New features include an efficient method for extending the forecasting scale, enabling predictions further into the future. We also augment the inference architecture with a new, fully serverless design which offers a more cost-effective solution and which seamlessly handles sporadic inference workloads over multiple forecasting scales. We observe that Graph Neural Network (GNN) forecasting models are robust to extensions of the forecasting scale, achieving consistent performance up to 48 hours ahead. This is in contrast to the 1 hour forecasting periods popularly considered in this context. Further, our serverless inference solution is shown to be more cost-effective than provisioned alternatives in corresponding use-cases. We identify the optimal memory configuration of serverless resources to achieve an attractive cost-to-performance ratio. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Accurate traffic flow prediction in road networks is essential for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Since traffic data are collected from the road network with spatial topological and time series sequences, the traffic flow prediction is regarded as a spatial–temporal prediction task. With the powerful ability to model the non-Euclidean data, the graph convolutional network (GCN)-based models have become the mainstream framework for traffic forecasting. However, existing GCN-based models either use the manually predefined graph structure to capture the spatial features, ignoring the heterogeneity of road networks, or simply perform 1-D convolution with fixed kernel to capture the temporal dependencies of traffic data, resulting in insufficient long-term temporal feature extraction. To solve those issues, a spatial–temporal correlation constrained dynamic graph convolutional network (STC-DGCN) is proposed for traffic flow forecasting. In STC-DGCN, a spatial–temporal embedding encoder module (STEM) is first constructed to encode the dynamic spatial relationships for road networks at different time steps. Then, a temporal feature encoder module with heterogeneous time series correlation modeling (TFE-HCM) and a spatial feature encoder module with dynamic multi-graph modeling (SFE-DCM) are designed to generate dynamic graph structures for effectively capturing the dynamic spatial and temporal correlations. Finally, a spatial–temporal feature fusion module based on a gating fusion mechanism (STM-GM) is proposed to effectively learn and leverage the inherent spatial–temporal relationships for traffic flow forecasting. Experimental results from three real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STC-DGCN compared with state-of-the-art traffic flow forecasting models. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in processing graph-structured data, making them attractive and promising for tasks such as recommender systems and traffic forecasting. However, GNNs’ irregular computational patterns limit their ability to achieve low latency and high energy efficiency, particularly in edge computing environments. Current GNN accelerators predominantly focus on value sparsity, underutilizing the potential performance gains from bit-level sparsity. However, applying existing bit-serial accelerators to GNNs presents several challenges. These challenges arise from GNNs’ more complex data flow compared to conventional neural networks, as well as difficulties in data localization and load balancing with irregular graph data. To address these challenges, we propose BEAST-GNN, a bit-serial GNN accelerator that fully exploits bit-level sparsity. BEAST-GNN introduces streamlined sparse-dense bit matrix multiplication for optimized data flow, a column-overlapped graph partitioning method to enhance data locality by reducing memory access inefficiencies, and a sparse bit-counting strategy to ensure balanced workload distribution across processing elements (PEs). Compared to state-of-the-art accelerators, including HyGCN, GCNAX, Laconic, GROW, I-GCN, SGCN, and MEGA, BEAST-GNN achieves speedups of 21.7 ×, 6.4×, 10.5×, 3.7×, 4.0×, 3.3×, and 1.4× respectively, while also reducing DRAM access by 36.3×, 7.9×, 6.6×, 3.9×, 5.38×, 3.37×, and 1.44×. Additionally, BEAST-GNN consumes only 4.8%, 12.4%, 19.6%, 27.7%, 17.0%, 26.5%, and 82.8% of the energy required by these architectures. © 1968-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Because of the high nonlinearity and complexity, it is still a challenge to forecast traffic flow accurately. Most of the existing methods, which lack the ability to model the dynamic spatio-temporal correlations of traffic flows, rely on a priori knowledge of the graph structure to capture static spatial correlations. However, spatial correlation can be dynamic and the physical structure does not reflect the true relationship between roads. To better capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and predict traffic conditions on road networks, a new forecasting model based on Transformer and Diffusion Graph Attention Network (T-DGAN) is proposed. This model adopts the Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder and decoder contain multiple Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network Blocks (ST-CB) and Diffusion Graph Attention Blocks (DGA-B), which are utilized to capture the spatio-temporal dependency and the dynamic spatial correlation of traffic flow separately. In addition, an information auxiliary module is added to the decoder to summarize the traffic flow information between the encoder and the decoder. Experiments on different datasets verify that the T-DGAN model has achieved higher forecasting performance than the baseline methods. In PEMS03, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of T-DGAN to 60 min are improved by 4.28% and 3.66%, compared with the state-of-the-art model, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - This study addresses the challenges of predicting traffic flow on arterial roads where dynamic behaviours such as passenger pick-ups, vehicle turns, and parking interruptions complicate forecasting. The research develops and evaluates unidirectional and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models using a dataset of 70,072 observations collected over 12 months from Hoddle Street in Melbourne, Australia. The models were trained to predict traffic speeds and volumes up to 60 min ahead. The results indicated that the BiLSTM model significantly outperformed unidirectional LSTM, achieving over 99% accuracy for speed predictions and over 96% for volume predictions. The research also tested the impacts of incorporating weather variables such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed on model performance, which was found to provide small improvements. Traffic flow prediction accuracy increased from 97.5% to 97.6% for 30-min horizons, and from 96.9% to 97.6% for 60-min horizons. Although the inclusion of weather data only marginally enhanced prediction performance, its inclusion has practical implications for public awareness of travel impacts under severe weather. The findings in this study highlight the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for traffic forecasting on arterial roads, establishing a foundation for future research in this area. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is a fundamental problem in intelligent transportation systems and learning long-range traffic representations with key information through spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) is a basic assumption of current traffic flow prediction models. However, due to structural limitations, existing STGNNs can only utilize short-range traffic flow data; therefore, the models cannot adequately learn the complex trends and periodic features in traffic flow. Besides, it is challenging to extract the key temporal information from the long historical traffic series and obtain a compact representation. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel LSTTN (Long-Short Term Transformer-based Network) framework comprehensively considering the long- and short-term features in historical traffic flow. First, we employ a masked subseries Transformer to infer the content of masked subseries from a small portion of unmasked subseries and their temporal context in a pretraining manner, forcing the model to efficiently learn compressed and contextual subseries temporal representations from long historical series. Then, based on the learned representations, long-term trend is extracted by using stacked 1D dilated convolution layers, and periodic features are extracted by dynamic graph convolution layers. For the difficulties in making time-step level prediction, LSTTN adopts a short-term trend extractor to learn fine-grained short-term temporal features. Finally, LSTTN fuses the long-term trend, periodic features and short-term features to obtain the prediction results. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that in 60-minute-ahead long-term forecasting, the LSTTN model achieves a minimum improvement of 5.63% and a maximum improvement of 16.78% over baseline models.

AB  - Accurate short-term traffic forecasting is a prerequisite for establishing intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, a new adaptive traffic flow sequence framework is processed. For any given dataset, the framework divides the original sequence into different time periods, generating an adaptive traffic flow sequence. Compared with the sequence using fixed aggregation intervals, adaptive traffic flow data is reduced by 33% on average. Subsequently, local and global prediction models are presented for adaptive traffic flow sequences. Namely, the data-extended GRU algorithm and data-adaptive Bi-GRU algorithm respectively demonstrate best mean absolute percentage error of 4.70% and 6.80% according to the data experiments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Accurately predicting traffic flow characteristics is crucial for effective urban transportation management. Emergence of artificial intelligence has led to the surge of deep learning methods for short-term traffic forecast. Notably, Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) have demonstrated remarkable prediction accuracy by incorporating road network topology into deep neural networks. However, many existing GCN-based models are based on the premise that the graph network is static, which may fail to do justice in replicating the situations in the real World. On one hand, real road networks are dynamic and undergo changes such as road maintenance and traffic control, leading to altered network structures over time. On the other hand, relationships between road sections can fluctuate due to factors like traffic accidents, weather conditions, and other events, which can significantly impact traffic patterns and result in inaccurate predictions if a static network and static relationships between nodes are assumed. To address these challenges, we propose the spatiotemporal dual adaptive graph convolutional network (ST-DAGCN) model for spatiotemporal traffic prediction, which utilizes a dual-adaptive adjacency matrix comprising both a static and a dynamic graph structure learning matrix. The dual-adaptive mechanism can adaptively learn the global features and the local dynamic features of the traffic states by updating the correlations of nodes at each prediction step, while the gated recurrent unit (GRU), which is also a component of the model, extracts the temporal dependencies of traffic data. Through a comprehensive comparison analysis on two real-world traffic datasets, our model has achieved the highest prediction accuracy when compared to other advanced models. © 2024

AB  - The rapid expansion of urban areas and the increasing number of vehicles on the road have resulted in accidents, traffic congestion, economic repercussions, environmental deterioration, and excessive fuel consumption. A dependable traffic management system is necessary to anticipate and regulate urban traffic patterns. Traffic forecast aids in the prevention of traffic issues. Urban traffic predictions often utilise historical and current traffic flow data to forecast road conditions. This article presents a traffic flow prediction system that utilises the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and feature selection. Internet of Things (IoT) devices located on highways or within cars gather sensor data in real-time. The input data set comprises both real-time Internet of Things (IoT) data and historical traffic statistics. The input data is stored in a centralized cloud. The data is subjected to preprocessing in order to eliminate any unwanted interference and identify any exceptional values. The accuracy and root mean square error are contingent upon the process of feature selection. Particle swarm optimization identifies and extracts crucial features from input data. The classification model is constructed using K Nearest Neighbor, Multi layer Perceptron, and Bayes network approaches. The UCI traffic data is used for conducting experiments. The dataset has 47 attributes and 2102 occurrences. The accuracy of traffic flow prediction using PSO KNN is 96 %. The PSO KNN algorithm achieved a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0.00289 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0595. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Deep learning models can effectively capture the non-linear spatiotemporal dynamics of city-wide traffic forecasting. Evidence of varying deep learning model performance between different cities, different prediction horizons, different scales, specific city regions, and during particular hours of the day abounds in the literature on deep learning-based traffic prediction, yet a unified metric to quantify the complexity of different prediction tasks does not exist. This paper proposes two metrics—model complexity (MC) and intrinsic complexity (IC). While MC quantifies the effective complexity of deep learning models for city-wide traffic prediction tasks, the IC quantifies the underlying complexity of the prediction task. Being an effective complexity metric, MC depends on the model and the data. The IC depends only on the data and is invariant to the model being used. Both metrics are validated through systematic experimentation using traffic volume data from three cities. Finally, we demonstrate how these metrics can improve the workflows for deep learning-based data-driven traffic prediction pipelines and deployment by reducing the hyperparameter search scope and comparing the effectiveness of different design pathways. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Spatio-temporal forecasting is critical in the traffic domain, where accurate predictions are essential for effective urban traffic management, planning, and simulation. Despite the importance of complete historical observations, missing values due to sensor failures, data transmission errors, and other issues are common, posing significant challenges to the accuracy and reliability of forecasting models. Existing methods often fail to systematically account for incomplete historical data, especially non-random data missing for extended periods. Fortunately, this study introduces the MissNet, a pre-training enhanced framework for spatio-temporal data forecasting in the presence of missing historical data. MissNet consists of a two-stage process: a pre-training stage where a data masking and recovering task is used to pre-train a backbone, and a fine-tuning stage where the pre-trained backbone, combined with a specially designed header, predicts future data incorporating spatio-temporal metadata as auxiliary information. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MissNet in achieving stable and accurate predictions under various missing data scenarios. © China Society of Automotive Engineers (China SAE) 2025.

AB  - Industrial internet traffic prediction is not only an academic problem, but also a concern of industry and network performance department. Efficient prediction of industrial internet traffic is helpful for protocol design, traffic scheduling, detection of network attacks, etc. This paper proposes an industrial internet traffic prediction method based on the Echo State Network. In the first place this paper proves that the industrial internet traffic data are self-similar by means of the calculation of Hurst exponent of each traffic time series. It indicates that industrial internet traffic can be predicted utilizing nonlinear time series models. Then Echo State Network is applied for industrial internet traffic forecasting. Furthermore, to avoid the weak-conditioned problem, grid search algorithm is used to optimize the reservoir parameters and coefficients.

AB  - Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems, playing a pivotal role in enhancing transportation intelligence. The integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers in traffic flow forecasting has gained significant adoption for enhancing prediction accuracy. Yet, the complex spatial and temporal dependencies present in traffic data continue to pose substantial challenges: (1) Most GNN-based methods assume that the graph structure reflects the actual dependencies between nodes, overlooking the complex dependencies present in the real-world context. (2) Standard time-series models are unable to effectively model complex temporal dependencies, hindering prediction accuracy. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a novel Transformer-based Spatiotemporal Graph Diffusion Convolution Network (TSGDC) for Traffic Flow Forecasting, which leverages graph diffusion and transformer to capture the complexity and dynamics of spatial and temporal patterns, thereby enhancing prediction performance. The authors designed an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) that learns separately from the feature dimensions collected by traffic sensors and the temporal dimensions of traffic data, aiding in spatiotemporal modeling. Chebyshev Graph Diffusion Convolution (GDC) is used to capture the complex dependencies within the spatial distribution. Sequence decomposition blocks, as internal operations of transformers, are employed to gradually extract long-term stable trends from hidden complex variables. Additionally, by integrating multi-scale dependencies, including recent, daily, and weekly patterns, accurate traffic flow predictions are achieved. Experimental results on various public datasets show that TSGDC outperforms conventional traffic forecasting models, particularly in accuracy and robustness. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting using deep learning represents a crucial aspect of intelligent transportation systems, carrying substantial implications for congestion reduction and efficient route planning. Despite its significance, accurately predicting traffic states remains a challenge. Existing methodologies focus on capturing the temporal trends of traffic states and the spatial dependencies between roads to enhance prediction accuracy. However, two noteworthy limitations persist in these approaches: (1) Many models neglect the interaction between spatiotemporal features across varying time spans, hindering their ability to utilize traffic state information effectively for predicting future conditions. (2) Genuine correlations between roads are time-varying, making it inadequate to rely on static graphs or static pre-trained node embeddings to model dynamic correlations between roads. To address these challenges, we propose the Multiple Time-Scale Graph Attention Network (MTS-GATN), which comprises two key modules: the Multiple Time-Scale Spatiotemporal Features Extraction Module and the Feature Augmentation Module. The first module involves stacking multiple spatiotemporal extraction layers to discern traffic state information at different time scales. In the second module, we employ dynamic spatial semantic embedding for feature augmentation, providing nodes with dynamic representations over time. Subsequently, we leverage a multi-head spatiotemporal attention mechanism to comprehensively consider location information and real-time semantic data, facilitating the interaction of traffic state information across multiple time scales. Experimental results on two distinct traffic datasets validate the superior performance of MTS-GATN in medium-term and long-term forecasting scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Accurate prediction of traffic flow is essential for optimizing transportation resource allocation and enhancing urban mobility efficiency. However, traffic data generated daily are vast and complex, involving dynamic and intricate changes in the traffic road network and traffic flow. Therefore, real-time and accurate prediction of traffic flow is a challenging task that requires modeling the intricate spatial–temporal dynamics of traffic data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for traffic flow prediction, based on a Multi-Scale Residual Graph Convolution Network with hierarchical attention. First, we design a novel encoder–decoder with multi-independent channels to capture traffic flow information from different time scales and diverse temporal dependencies. Second, we employ a coupled graph convolution network with residual graph attention to dynamically learn the varying spatial features among and within traffic stations. Third, we utilize channel attention to fuse the multi-scale spatial–temporal dependencies and accurately predict traffic flow. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of various metrics. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The way humans travel and even their daily commute, is gradually expanding beyond the confines of counties and cities. Traffic between counties, cities, and even across the entire state is increasingly becoming a common aspect of daily activities. The demand for traffic flow forecasting covering larger geographical areas and longer time spans is ongoing. However, existing studies lack targeted deep model proposals for large-scale forecasting. To address this gap, we propose Spatiotemporal Fusion Transformer (STFT). Specifically, we propose three modules on top of the Transformer architecture: (i) Seasonality Encoding, based on the multi-periodicity inherent in traffic flow to facilitate the extraction of more predictable time-variant components from complex patterns. (ii) Tubelet Embedding, partitioning the input into Tubelets as input tokens for the Transformer. The Tubelet design not only achieves quadratic reductions in computational and memory usage but also enhances spatiotemporal locality feature modelling. (iii) Token Permutator, leveraging diffusion graph to model the spatiotemporal dynamics as a token permutation process. The graph representation is then projected by a proposed Hadamard Mapper to circumvent the anomaly sensitivities of Graph Neural Networks in large-scale computations. Experimental results on five real-world datasets indicate that STFT can cater to collaborative forecasting at diverse scales (subdivision, county, municipal, state) that not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also enjoys a large speedup of up to 4.46×. Lastly, we also find that compared to independent forecasting for each subregion, large-scale collaborative forecasting with STFT offers both better feature utilization and requires less computational cost. © 2024

AB  - Preliminary feasibility studies (PFSs) have become Korea's unique budgetary and fiscal management system. With a critical role in decisions regarding the viability of a proposed project, a PFS prevents inefficient projects, contributing to securing a budget and thus improving fiscal efficiency. Since the introduction of PFS in 1999, until 2021, 767 corresponding studies have been conducted, and it has become an indispensable component of budgetary decision making in Korea. This study analyzes the uncertainty in forecasts of traffic, costs, and benefits in Korea's PFS through a case study of a road PFS project. The probability distributions of the forecasts were investigated based on the historical accuracy of the PFS; as a result, the probability of the benefit being higher than the forecast in the PFS case project was only 0.195, and the probability of the cost being less than 90% of the forecast cost was only 0.256. Accordingly, the probability of the benefit–cost ratio (BCR) higher than 1.0, which was the forecasted BCR result in the PFS case project, was only 0.048. Therefore, the economic feasibility evaluation of PFS exhibits a high level of uncertainty and vulnerability. This study reveals how forecasters can use empirical measures of the accuracy of past forecasts to consider the uncertainty of traffic forecasts, costs, and benefits of their PFS projects. The uncertainty window can aid in determining whether forecast uncertainty will change a project decision or propose alternative project options that can ensure economic feasibility. This study reiterates the necessity for decision makers to be aware of the uncertainty in their transport investment decisions, and highlights the necessity of introducing a new method for evaluating economic feasibility that does not rely on a single forecast value. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently achieved remarkable success in learning graph structures and have been applied in a variety of practical applications such as medical diagnosis, drug discovery, chemical compound synthesis, and traffic forecasting. However, like other deep learning methods, GNNs are black-box networks with inexplicable results, restricting the applicability of GNNs in many important applications such as biochemistry and medicine. This paper focuses on the field of explaining graph learning methods, which is still less explored and lacks strong theoretical grounds. Based on Shapley value from game theory, we propose a novel graph explainer, named Shapley and Embedding-based Graph Explainer (SEGE), which builds a linear approximator in node embedding space to interpret the GNNs’ prediction of an input graph. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SEGE achieves state-of-the-art performance and is significantly better than baseline models both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, SEGE owns the capacity of automorphic equivalence preservation, which is not observed in existing explainers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the backdrop of an ever-expanding urban transportation road network, the dramatic changes in traffic flow make traffic flow forecasting become a challenge. Which encompass intricate spatial correlations and intricate non-linear temporal relationships. Given a complex time series of traffic flow, accurately predicting traffic flow under such circumstances becomes an arduous task, particularly for long-term sequences. To tackle this conundrum, we put together a traffic prediction framework called the multi-scale attention-based graph convolutional recurrent network (MAGRN). Based on GCN and RNN, this framework skilfully extracts dynamic spatial and temporal features from node attributes. By incorporating multi-scale feature extraction and two attention mechanisms within the attention structure, MAGRN adeptly captures features at varying granularities. This enables MAGRN to diligently capture both the temporal interdependencies and spatial correlations inherent in traffic sequences, thereby minimizing errors. Experimental validation on three real-world traffic datasets unequivocally attests to the superior performance of the MAGRN model. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Accurate and timely forecasting of traffic on local road networks is crucial for deploying effective dynamic traffic control, advanced route planning, and navigation services. This task is particularly challenging due to complex spatio-temporal dependencies arising from non-Euclidean spatial relations in road networks and non-linear temporal dynamics influenced by changing road conditions. This paper introduces the spatio-temporal network embedding (STNE) model, a novel deep learning framework tailored for learning and forecasting graph-structured traffic data over extended input sequences. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model employs graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture the spatial characteristics of local road network topologies. Moreover, the segmentation of very long input traffic data into multiple sub-sequences, based on significant temporal properties such as closeness, periodicity, and trend, is performed. Multi-dimensional long short-term memory neural networks (MDLSTM) are utilized to flexibly access multi-dimensional context. Experimental results demonstrate that the STNE model surpasses state-of-the-art traffic forecasting benchmarks on two large-scale real-world traffic datasets. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic sensor networks are widely applied in smart cities to monitor traffic in real-time. Exploiting such data to forecast future traffic conditions has the potential to enhance the decision-making capabilities of intelligent transportation systems, which attracts widespread attention from both industries and academia. Among them, network-wide prediction based on graph convolutional neural networks(GCN) has become mainstream. It models the spatial dependencies of sensors in a graph with a pre-defined Laplacian matrix. However, understanding spatio-temporal traffic patterns is quite challenging as there is a huge difference in terms of traffic patterns during different periods or in different regions. In addition, the actual data collected can be polluted due to unavoidable data loss from severe communication conditions or sensor failures. Considering these issues, we propose a novel dynamic multiview spatial-temporal prediction framework which takes into consideration various factors, including local/global, short/long term spatio-temporal dependencies and their dynamic changes. We creatively design two different modules to comprehensively perceive the changes in traffic patterns. We first propose a dynamic learning module based on our theoretical derivation to estimate the Laplacian matrix of the graph for GCN timely. We also design a self-attention based module to dynamically assign a weight to each part in traffic data. The spatio-temporal features from multiple views are deeply fused by a feature fusion module. The forecasting performance is evaluated with 5 real-time traffic datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art baselines and be more robust under noisy environments.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This study introduces and evaluates the Long-term Traffic Prediction Network (LTPN), a specialized machine learning framework designed for real-time traffic prediction in urban environments. Utilizing a unique combination of convolutional and recurrent neural network layers, the LTPN model consistently outperforms established predictive models across various metrics.

AB  - Network bandwidth is a scarce resource that network operators monitor to cope with future traffic demands and plan more transceiver and fibre deployments. The inclusion of Machine Learning permits the usage of traffic forecasting methods to predict future link usage. Typically, traffic analysis is performed offline due to the high computational load and difficulty of obtaining real-time data directly from the underlying network devices. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents and evaluates an architecture for SDN-controlled packetoptical transport networks to allow real-time traffic monitoring in the transport SDN controller. The presented SDN controller is based on a micro-service-based architecture, which facilitates the ease of deployment of the proposed solution. Four forecasting methods are proposed and evaluated against two topologies to select the most precise and the fastest among them.The algorithm random forest seems to be the most accurate forecasting future link usage with 79.98 % and 95.88 % accuracy and a reasonable fast speed when implemented it into two different topologies © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forecasting traffic flow is crucial for Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS), traffic control, and traffic management systems. Complex spatial and temporal interactions of traffic networks make traffic forecasting tasks challenging. Recently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has attracted researchers’ attention as it can better represent graph-shaped road networks and extract spatial features of traffic. However, traditional GCN has some drawbacks since it uses a static adjacency matrix which is unable to capture the time-varying features of traffic propagation. To overcome this, we represent the traffic road network as a dynamic graph and use a probabilistic spatiotemporal adjacency matrix to identify the time-varying impacts of adjacent roads on target roads in GCN. In addition, to find the similarity among the nonadjacent nodes, we have employed node-specific learning in GCN rather than sharing parameters in traditional GCN. This node-specific learning helps our model to learn detailed characteristics of road networks. For temporal feature extractions, we used a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) that captures the local trend of traffic flow and an attention mechanism to capture the global trend of traffic flow. We compared the performance of our model with baseline models using two real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our model is effective in forecasting both short and long-term traffic flow.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is the foundation of traffic scheduling and a major component of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). Accurate traffic flow prediction is crucial for numerous real-world traffic applications. However, the complex and dynamic nature of spatiotemporal correlations in traffic flow data poses obstacles to this task. Another important factor hindering model improvement is the scarcity of spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, most existing studies assume the traffic data collected by sensors in real scenarios is completely correct and trustworthy, thereby neglecting the anomalies and incorrect data. To address these issues, we propose the contrastive learning-based adaptive graph fusion convolution network with residual-enhanced decomposition strategy (CDAGF) for traffic flow forecasting, which performs a simple yet effective graph augmentation mechanism imposed only on the learned graphs and reserves the explicit graph to mitigate the data scarcity problem, and designs a negative filter to assign negative pairs based on timestamp information. Besides, CDAGF separates anomalous signals from valid traffic signals through a residual-enhanced decomposition strategy to weaken the impact of anomalies and further improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover, CDAGF generates static graph and dynamic graphs based on traffic signals as well as timestamp information and fuses the learned graphs with the explicit graph to model temporal and spatial characteristics dynamically and adaptively. The experimental results on five popular public data sets demonstrate that CDAGF achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18.29 mean absolute error (MAE) on the PEMS04 data set.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting belongs to intelligent transportation systems and is helpful for public property and life safety. Therefore, to forecast traffic accurately, researchers pay great attention to dealing with complex problems by mining intricate spatial and temporal dependencies of the traffic. However, some challenges still hold back traffic forecasting: 1) Most studies mainly focus on modeling correlations of traffic time series of close distances on the road network and ignore correlations of remote but similar traffic time series; 2) Previous static graph-based methods failed to reflect the dynamic changed spatial relations of multiple time series in the evolving traffic system. To tackle the above issues, we design a new dynamic multigraph spatio-temporal convolution network (DMGSTCN) in this article, which utilizes the gated causal convolution with the dynamic multigraph convolution network (DMGCN) to simultaneously extract spatial and temporal information. Specifically, DMGCN uses not only distance-based graphs but also structure-based graphs to obtain spatial information from nearby and remote but similar traffic time series, respectively. Moreover, to dynamically model spatial correlations, DMGCN first splits neighbors of each traffic time series into different regions according to relative position relationships. Then DMGCN assigns different weights to different regions at different time slices. Empirical evaluations on four traffic forecasting benchmarks reveal that DMGSTCN outperforms existing methods.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is important for refining traffic management and planning to avoid congestion on the roads and enhance road safety. Traditional models often misfire on complex, nonlinear patterns in traffic. In this study, the hybrid LSTM-CNN model proposed in this paper would overcome the limitations by modeling both temporal and spatial dependencies, thus ensuring better accuracy and reliability in prediction. The study portrays the hybrid model of LSTM-CNN to overcome all such limitations and focus on capturing the temporal and spatial dependencies pertaining to traffic features. The paper uses a rich dataset comprising variables like volume, speed, and occupancy from highway sensors. It gives a model using LSTM layers in combination with CNN to perform better in prediction. Further refinements were done in training using hyperparameters; the evaluation of performance was executed on R², MAPE, and RMSE. The hybrid model gave the lowest validation loss of 0.05 and the lowest test MAPE of 0.08, which is better than the conventional models. More precisely, from the LSTM model, R² score = 0.081, MAPE = 3.66%, and RMSE = 0.248; from the CNN model, R² score = 0.029, MAPE = 4.07%, and RMSE = 0.255. R² of 0.063, MAPE of 3.84%, and RMSE of 0.250 were found for the hybrid model, with LSTM before CNN. In reversed order—that is, the hybrid model of CNN first—the values are as follows: the model recorded an R² of 0.054, a MAPE of 4.15%, and an RMSE of 0.252. © 2024 Seventh Sense Research Group®.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is crucial for public safety and resource optimization, yet is very challenging due to the temporal changes and the dynamic spatial correlations. To capture these intricate dependencies, spatio-temporal networks, such as recurrent neural networks with graph convolution networks, are applied. However, traffic forecasting is still a non-trivial task because of three major challenges: 1) Previous spatio-temporal networks are based on end-to-end training and thus fail to handle the distribution shift in the non-stationary traffic time series. 2) Existing methods always utilize the one-hour input to forecast future traffic and the long-term historical trend knowledge is ignored. 3) The efficient and effective algorithm for modeling multi-scale spatial correlations is still lacking in prior networks. Therefore, in this paper, rather than proposing yet another end-to-end model, we provide a novel disentangle-fusion framework STWave+ to mitigate the distribution shift issue. The framework first decouples the complex one-hour traffic data into stable trends and fluctuating events, followed by a dual-channel spatio-temporal network to model trends and events, respectively. Moreover, long-term trends are used as a self-supervised signal in STWave+ to teach overall temporal information into one-hour trends through a contrastive loss. Finally, reasonable future traffic can be predicted through the adaptive fusion of one-hour trends and events. Additionally, we incorporate a novel query sampling strategy and multi-scale graph wavelet positional encoding into the full graph attention network to efficiently and effectively model dynamic hierarchical spatial correlations. Extensive experiments on four traffic datasets show the superiority of our approach, i.e., the higher forecasting accuracy with lower computational cost.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is critical to improving the safety, stability, and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Although many spatiotemporal analysis methods have been proposed, accurate traffic prediction still faces many challenges, for example, it is difficult for long-term predictions to model the dynamics of traffic data in temporal and spatial to capture the periodicity and spatial heterogeneity of traffic data. Most existing studies relieve this problem by discovering hidden spatiotemporal dependencies with graph neural networks and attention mechanisms. However, the period-related information between spatiotemporal sequences is not sufficiently considered in these models. Therefore, we propose a local global spatiotemporal attention network (LGA) to solve the above challenge. Specifically, we present a local spatial attention module to extract the spatial correlation of hourly, daily, and weekly periodic information. We propose a weight attention mechanism to assign different weights of the periodic feature extracted on local spatial attention. The local periodic temporal features are extracted through the local temporal attention we proposed. And we develop the global spatiotemporal attention module to extract the global spatiotemporal information of the entire time slice, which is more conducive to learning the periodic features of traffic data. The extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness to our proposed model.The code is publicly available on github1 (github: https://github.com/lyc2580/LGAmodel.). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - In the era of data-driven transportation development, traffic forecasting is crucial. Established studies either ignore the inherent spatial structure of the traffic network or ignore the global spatial correlation and may not capture the spatial relationships adequately. In this work, a Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Network (DSTN) based on Joint Latent Space Representation (JLSR) is proposed for traffic forecasting. Specifically, in the spatial dimension, a JLSR network is developed by integrating graph convolution and spatial attention operations to model complex spatial dependencies. Since it can adaptively fuse the representation information of local topological space and global dynamic space, a more comprehensive spatial dependency can be captured. In the temporal dimension, a Stacked Bidirectional Unidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (SBUGRU) network is developed, which captures long-term temporal dependencies through both forward and backward computations and superimposed recurrent layers. On these bases, DSTN is developed in an encoder-decoder framework and periodicity is flexibly modeled by embedding branches. The performance of DSTN is validated on two types of real-world traffic flow datasets, and it improves over baselines. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a crucial aspect of modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), playing a vital role in improving the safety and efficiency of daily transportation activities. Despite the valuable contributions of traditional machine learning (ML) models and advanced deep learning (DL) techniques, there persist challenges in capturing the intricate spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in traffic flow. In response to these challenges, we present GRAPHITE, an innovative framework that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to leverage generative reasoning for efficient traffic management. Our model seamlessly integrates historical traffic volume data collected by road sensors with local spatial information encoded through knowledge graphs (KGs) associated with each sensor. These KGs offer a structured representation of relationships between traffic sensors and points of interest (POIs) in their neighborhood, thereby enhancing the comprehension of the urban context and leading to more accurate traffic predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets underscore the efficacy of GRAPHITE. Notably, we achieved a maximum decrease in RMSE of 31.05% compared to GAN-GRU and a maximum increase in R2 of 8.15% compared to GAN-RNN, positioning GRAPHITE as a standout solution among the current state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - An efficient transportation system is conducive to maintaining traffic flow and safety. Passenger flow forecasting (PFF), an area of traffic forecasting, is a key part of the efficient transportation system. In recent years, deep-learning-based models have led to extensive research on the different conditions in this field. Hence, model determination is the most suitable for a specific application would be a key advantage. To address this issue, a comparative analysis of nine typical deep network approaches, including recurrent neural network (long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU)), bidirectional-based RNN (BiLSTM and BiGRU), convolutional neural network (CNN) (CNN1D and CNN2D), convolutional LSTM, and hybrid network (CNN1D-LSTM and CNN1D-GRU), for hourly PFF has been conducted. This comparison utilized two datasets with hourly records of bus lines from Guangzhou, China. The comparison results show that the bidirectional-based models were slightly better than other candidates in terms of the values of the root-mean-square error, determination coefficient, and Theil coefficient, and had a lower individual error distribution than the others, both numerically and proportionally. Furthermore, the bidirectional-based models were different from the other models in terms of the Friedman test (a special case is that the BiLSTM and LSTM had no significant difference for Line 10 application). Besides, the results from model structure aspect indicated that the bidirectional-based models achieved better performance with stable and reliable model structure (measurement index: posterior error distribution) and less computational complexity (measurement index: number of floating-point operations and parameters). It is concluded that the bidirectional-based deep learning models are the preferential choice for hourly PFF. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays a vital role in the management of urban road networks and the development of intelligent transportation systems. To effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies within traffic data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerge by combining recurrent neural networks and dynamic graph learning. However, traditional GNNs face challenges in efficiently memorizing patterns at different levels of these dependencies, including long-term shared patterns and short-term specific patterns. We propose a traffic forecasting model, the Multi-level Graph Memory Network Cluster Convolutional Recurrent Network (MMNCCRN). The MMNCCRN consists of four modules: Encoder Module (EM), Attention Module (AM), Memory Network Cluster Module (MNCM), and Decoder Module (DM). To enhance the model's performance, AM incorporates a concise yet efficient attention mechanism that augments important information in the output of EM. This alleviates the pressure on MNCM to identify patterns at different levels. Meanwhile, in MNCM, we extensively leverage memory networks and introduce the concept of clustering. By storing and memorizing patterns implicit in spatial and temporal dependencies, MNCM assists the model in learning underlying graph structures and discovering new hidden patterns. Experimental results show that our model outperforms others in most metrics on four datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and explainability in traffic prediction models remains a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a traffic flow prediction model based on large language models (LLMs) to generate explainable traffic predictions, named xTP-LLM. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, xTP-LLM captures complex time-series patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, xTP-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive and reliable explanation for predictions. This study contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The issue of road traffic congestion has become increasingly apparent in modern times. With the rise of urbanization, technological advancements, and an increase in the number of vehicles on the road, almost all major cities are experiencing poor traffic environments and low road efficiency. To address this problem, re-searchers have turned to diverse data resources and focused on predicting traffic flow, a crucial issue in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that can help al-leviate congestion. By analyzing data from correlated roads and vehicles, such as speed, density, and flow rate, it is possible to anticipate traffic congestion and patterns. This paper presents an adaptive traffic system that utilizes supervised ma-chine learning and big data analytics to predict traffic flow. The system monitors and extracts relevant traffic flow data, analyzes and processes the data, and stores it to enhance the model's accuracy and effectiveness. A simulation was conducted by the authors to showcase the proposed solution. The outcomes of the study car-ry substantial implications for transportation systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing traffic flow management. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays a critical role in intelligent transportation systems aiming to accurately estimate future short-term or long-term traffic conditions. The utilization of neural network-based methods for traffic forecasting has demonstrated significant success. Those models aggregate spatial and temporal information from historical traffic records. The final output module of these models typically utilizes either a fully connected network to directly produce the results or a recurrent neural network to generate results step by step. However, these approaches fail to consider the spatial-temporal dependencies between predicted future traffic conditions, which hinders their forecasting performance. To address this limitation as well as improve forecasting accuracy, we propose a novel traffic prediction framework called the Generative Corrective Network. This framework consists of two procedures: a generative model that captures the spatial temporal relationships inherent in historical traffic condition and generates initial predictions, and a corrective model that amends and updates previous results by considering the relationships among future traffic data to be predicted. To implement this generative corrective network, we design an instantiation utilizing adaptive and dynamic graph convolutional networks with gated recurrent units networks (ADGCN-GRU) based on encoder–decoder structure for the generator, and a local asynchronous attention model conducted on the the representation learning of space and time information and the preliminary results for the corrector. Experiments conducted on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our model can effectively improve forecasting performance compared to existing neural network-based methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Traffic congestion in urban areas has become a major worldwide problem. As an important direction of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), traffic-speed prediction can help drivers better plan routes and shorten travel time according to IOT techniques, thereby effectively alleviating the problem of traffic congestion. Traffic speed changes dynamically over time, so forecasting using historical data may not be able to quickly adapt to sudden changes in traffic conditions, and predicted traffic conditions may lag behind. The use of real-time data can capture instantaneous changes in traffic conditions, which is more adaptable to different traffic scenarios. In order to further explore the advantages of using real-time data for traffic forecasting, a novel real-time Data Driven method for traffic Speed trend Prediction (2DSP) is proposed. The 2DSP method can predict the macro-level traffic speed trend (rising or falling) by using only near-real-time microscopic vehicle information, which effectively captures the dynamic changes in traffic speed. In addition, an adaptive time-slicing strategy based on traffic density is proposed. This strategy dynamically divides time slices based on traffic density, reducing the frequency of data processing and improving the user experience. The effectiveness of the 2DSP method is validated using two real traffic datasets of floating vehicles. The experimental results show that the 2DSP method has good potential for real-time traffic-speed trend prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic speed forecasting is indispensable in Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS). The missing traffic speed due to sensors’ failure may hamper the accurate prediction of traffic speed. Different kinds of imputation techniques were employed to replace the missing values considering the spatial and temporal information. However, previous techniques did not consider the dynamic contribution of the neighboring nodes and failed to capture the complex properties of traffic speed data precisely. The architecture of the previous imputation models was infeasible in real-time applications in terms of scalability. Therefore, a novel machine learning-based imputation technique is proposed to generate the missing traffic speed using the spatial–temporal information and dynamic contribution of neighboring nodes. A new dataset considering the characteristics of the traffic speed data is generated from the existing dataset by exploiting the non-missing traffic speed of neighboring nodes. The newly formed dataset helps in the estimation of the dynamic contribution of the neighboring nodes using the linear regression algorithm. The non-missing speeds and estimated dynamic contribution of neighboring nodes assist in calculating the missing speeds of a node. Furthermore, a novel deep learning-based prediction model is introduced to forecast traffic speed accurately. The prediction model contains graph structure learning, a deep graph neural network with skip connections, GRU, multi-head soft attention, and a fully connected neural network. Graph structure learning is proposed based on the distribution of the congestion to represent the graph in an efficient way. The deep graph neural network with skip connections and GRU help in capturing topological and temporal information, respectively. The multi-head soft attention is designed to focus on every relevant temporal information at each time step for capturing global traffic information. Finally, the extracted spatial–temporal features are fed into the fully connected neural network to predict the traffic speed. The proposed imputation and prediction models are evaluated on two real-time datasets, METR-LA and PeMSD7 datasets, under different missing rates of different missing patterns. The proposed framework generates possible spatial–temporal information for efficient traffic congestion management and evicts erroneous issues in real-time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Symmetry in traffic patterns is a fundamental aspect of intelligent transportation systems, aiming to precisely predict traffic flow in real time despite the complex interplay of spatial and temporal factors. This paper presents a novel method of traffic forecasting that incorporates parameters related to road symmetry into a Graph Convolution Network model. Our model is crafted to dynamically adjust to real-time changes in road conditions, including the presence of symmetric and asymmetric road layouts, which substantially influence traffic flow. We have developed a GCN model that not only accounts for standard traffic flow metrics but also integrates a matrix representing road symmetry. The model undergoes training and validation on the METR-LA dataset, showcasing a significant enhancement in prediction accuracy. In the comparative analysis of state-of-the-art methods, our model demonstrated a significant enhancement in performance, achieving 30.68% improvement in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and a 24.28% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over the best-performing method. The implications of our research are profound for urban planners, traffic management systems, and navigation service providers, as it offers a more dependable tool for forecasting traffic conditions, aiding in road design, and refining route planning strategies based on the symmetry of road networks. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Recognizing the evolution pattern of traffic condition and making accurate prediction play a vital role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). With the massive increase of available traffic data, deep learning-based models have attracted considerable attention for their impressive performance in traffic forecasting. However, the majority of existing approaches neglect to model of asynchronously dynamic spatio-temporal correlation and fail to consider the impact of historical traffic data on future condition. Additionally, the attribute of deep learning method presents challenges in interpreting the explicit spatiotemporal relationships. In order to enhance the accuracy of traffic prediction as well as extract comprehensive and explainable spatial–temporal relevance in traffic networks, we propose a novel attention-based local spatial and temporal relation discovery (ALSTRD) model. Our model firstly implements feature representation learning to effectively express latent input traffic information. Then, a local attention mechanism structure is established to model asynchronous dependencies of historical input data. Finally, another attention network and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient method are introduced to extract the elaborate influence of the historical traffic condition of neighboring roads on the future condition of the target road. The experiment results on several datasets demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to other baseline methods, which can be attributed to its ability to extract the fine-grained correlation among historical traffic data and capture the dynamic association between past and future data. In addition, the incorporation of attention mechanism and Pearson Correlation Coefficient promotes the model's ability to elucidate spatiotemporal correlations among traffic data, thereby providing a more robust explanation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting, a vital task of multivariate time series prediction, has recently expanded to incorporate Points of Interest (POI) as an additional source of data. Rather than merely leveraging historical traffic flows, POIs facilitate the understanding of inherent geographical connections and potential functional interactions between nodes. However, traditional POI-based methods tend to use POI as static feature embeddings to compute functional similarity matrices, failing to consider the dynamic influence of node functionality on traffic patterns. This overlooks the reality that even regions with analogous POIs can exhibit fluctuating traffic flow trends, particularly over extended periods. In this paper, we propose the POI-based Double-deck Graph Convolution Network (PDGCN) for more nuanced traffic forecasting. To identify potential POI-based traffic patterns, we employ the spectral clustering method to group nodes with comparable POI functionalities into regions. We then devise a POI-based dynamic graph module with temporal convolution and attention mechanisms to trace the evolving relationships between traffic nodes. This novel design underpins regional features. Experiments on two real datasets demonstrate that PDGCN effectively detects dynamic functional relationships between nodes and delivers superior prediction accuracy. ©2024 X. Zhao, Z. Wu, X.

AB  - In many fields, spatiotemporal prediction is gaining more and more attention, e.g., air pollution, weather forecasting, and traffic forecasting. Water quality prediction is a spatiotemporal prediction task. However, there are several challenges in water quality prediction: 1) Water quality time series has a complex nonlinear relationship, making it difficult to predict; 2) Water quality sensors are distributed on the river networks and have a strong spatial dependence on water quality prediction; and 3) Poor long-term forecast accuracy. To solve these problems, this work proposes a spatiotemporal prediction model called a Fusion Spatio-temporal Graph Convolution Neural network (FSGCN). First, This work uses a temporal attention mechanism to solve the nonlinear problem of water quality time series. Second, It adopts a graph convolution to extract spatial dependencies of river networks, and the fusion of spatiotemporal can more easily capture spatiotemporal features. Third, it adopts a temporal convolution residual mechanism, improving long-term series prediction accuracy. This work adopts two real-world datasets to evaluate the proposed FSGCN, and experiments demonstrate that FSGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy. Note to Practitioners - This work considers the critical problem of spatiotemporal water quality prediction. Accurate water quality prediction can effectively prevent environmental pollution. Traditional water quality prediction only focuses on time series features without considering spatial features. In this work, a novel spatiotemporal prediction approach is proposed that combines spatial-temporal graph fusion construction networks for water quality time series prediction in a real-time manner. This work shows that this approach can achieve longer forecasting sequences and more accurate results than traditional forecasting methods. As a practical consequence of this research, spatiotemporal graph fusion convolution networks for water quality prediction can effectively integrate multi-dimensional data and improve the accuracy of long-term water quality prediction. This approach can also be applied to other fields, including intelligent transportation, smart manufacturing, finance, the Internet of Things, and urban computing.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - To improve forecasting accuracy and capture complex interactions within transportation networks, information fusion approaches are crucial for traffic predictions based on graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs offer a potentially effective framework for capturing complex patterns and interactions among diverse elements, such as road segments and crossings, by considering both temporal and geographical dependencies. Although GNN-based traffic forecasting has recently been investigated in many studies, there is a need for comprehensive reviews that examine information fusion approaches for GNN-based traffic predictions, including an analysis of their benefits and challenges. This study addresses this knowledge gap and offers future insights into the potential advancements and developing fields of research in GNN-based fusion techniques, as well as their implications in urban planning and smart cities. Existing research demonstrates that the accuracy of traffic forecasting is substantially enhanced by information fusion techniques based on GNNs in comparison to more conventional approaches. By integrating information fusion methods with GNNs, the model is capable of capturing complex temporal and spatial relationships between various locations in a traffic network. Multi-source data integration benefits traffic forecasting models, including social events, weather conditions, real-time traffic sensor data, and historical traffic patterns. In addition, combining GNNs with other artificial intelligence (AI) methods like evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning could be an efficient strategy. With the potential to combine the best features of several methods, hybrid models could improve overall performance and flexibility in challenging traffic situations. © 2024

AB  - Traffic forecasting has always been a critical component of intelligent transportation systems. Due to the complexity of traffic prediction models, most research just only consider short-term historical data in the temporal dimension. However, learning temporal patterns necessitates the involvement of long-term historical data. Additionally, many models are limited in capturing spatial features by only considering short-distance spatial information connected to the target node. To solve these problems, we propose a dual-graph transformer, namely Long-term Correlations Dual-graph transFormer (LCDFormer), designed to capture long-term correlations and long-distance spatial correlations. It is entirely based on attention mechanisms, and as far as we know, there is limited research adopting this approach. Our work addresses this gap in the literature. In particular, we have devised a time aggregation method capable of consolidating long-term historical time series, concurrently addressing the impact of long-term temporal correlations while minimizing the influence of redundant data. Subsequently, we have introduced a novel spatio-temporal attention module that compresses spatial information to generate short-term input sequences while modeling dynamic long-range spatial correlations. We conducted extensive experiments with LCDFormer on five real-world traffic datasets. The results indicate that LCDFormer, considering long-term spatio-temporal correlations, is better able to learn the spatio-temporal patterns of traffic data. Compared to the current state-of-the-art baseline, our model has demonstrated outstanding predictive performance with a maximum improvement of 5.02% in mean absolute error, 4.33% in root mean square error and 7.32% in mean absolute percentage error.

AB  - In recent years, the explosion of extensive geolocated datasets related to human mobility has presented an opportunity to unravel the mechanism behind daily mobility patterns on an individual and population level; this analysis is essential for solving social matters, such as traffic forecasting, disease spreading, urban planning, and pollution. However, the release of such data is limited owing to the privacy concerns of users from whom data were collected. To overcome this challenge, an innovative approach has been introduced for generating synthetic human mobility, termed as the “Pseudo-PFLOW” dataset. Our approach leverages open statistical data and a limited travel survey to create a comprehensive synthetic representation of human mobility. The Pseudo-PFLOW generator comprises three agent models that follow seven fundamental daily activities and captures the spatiotemporal pattern in daily travel behaviors of individuals. The Pseudo-PFLOW dataset covers the entire population in Japan, approximately 130 million people across 47 prefectures, and has been compared with the existing ground truth dataset. Our generated dataset successfully reconstructs key statistical properties, including hourly population distribution, trip volume, and trip coverage, with coefficient of determination values ranging from 0.5 to 0.98. This innovative approach enables researchers and policymakers to access valuable mobility data while addressing privacy concerns, offering new opportunities for informed decision-making and analysis. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Spatial–temporal data is widely available in intelligent transportation systems, and accurately solving non-stationary of spatial–temporal regression is critical. In most traffic flow prediction research, the non-stationary solution of deep spatial–temporal regression tasks is typically formulated as a spatial–temporal graph modeling problem. However, there are several issues: (1) the coupled spatial–temporal regression approach renders it unfeasible to accurately learn the dependencies of diverse modalities; (2) the intricate stacking design of deep spatial–temporal network modules limits the interpretation and migration capability; (3) the ability to model dynamic spatial–temporal relationships is inadequate. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we propose a novel unified spatial–temporal regression framework named Generalized Spatial–Temporal Regression Graph Convolutional Transformer (GSTRGCT) that extends panel model in spatial econometrics and combines it with deep neural networks to effectively model non-stationary relationships of spatial–temporal regression. Considering the coupling of existing deep spatial–temporal networks, we introduce the tensor decomposition to explicitly decompose the panel model into a tensor product of spatial regression on the spatial hyper-plane and temporal regression on the temporal hyper-plane. On the spatial hyper-plane, we present dynamic adaptive spatial weight network (DASWNN) to capture the global and local spatial correlations. Specifically, DASWNN adopts spatial weight neural network (SWNN) to learn the semantic global spatial correlation and dynamically adjusts the local changing spatial correlation by multiplying between spatial nodes embedding. On the temporal hyper-plane, we introduce the Auto-Correlation attention mechanism to capture the period-based temporal dependence. Extensive experiments on the two real-world traffic datasets show that GSTRGCT consistently outperforms other competitive methods with an average of 62% and 59% on predictive performance. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The spatial–temporal graph neural networks have been a critical approach to capturing the complicated spatial–temporal dependencies inherent in traffic series for more accurate forecasting. However, the issue of graph indistinguishability demands further attention, as graphs learned by existing methods tend to converge to implicit and indistinguishable representations, deviating from the genuine distribution. This issue can be attributed to the lack of three primary factors within graphs: the intrinsic graph features, the temporal-distinct features, and the node-distinct features. Aiming to address this problem, we propose a Temporal-Aware Structure-Semantic-Coupled Graph Network (TASSGN) in this paper. Firstly, we design a novel graph learning block to simultaneously learn the structural and semantic aspects of graphs, thereby capturing inherent graph features. Secondly, we propose an innovative Self-Sampling method to sample the relevant history series and present a Temporal-Aware Graphs Encoder to explicitly incorporate temporal information into graph learning and capture temporal-distinct features. Thirdly, sparse graphs are intentionally generated to capture node-distinct features. By combining these three key components together, our method is capable of overcoming the problem of graph indistinguishability and achieving state-of-the-art performances in traffic forecasting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a dominant approach for developing traffic forecasting models. These models are typically trained to minimize error on averaged test cases and produce a single-point prediction, such as a scalar value for traffic speed or travel time. However, single-point predictions fail to account for prediction uncertainty that is critical for many transportation management scenarios, such as determining the best- or worst-case arrival time. We present QuanTraffic, a generic framework to enhance the capability of an arbitrary DNN model for uncertainty modeling. QuanTraffic requires little human involvement and does not change the base DNN architecture during deployment. Instead, it automatically learns a standard quantile function during the DNN model training to produce a prediction interval for the single-point prediction. The prediction interval defines a range where the true value of the traffic prediction is likely to fall. Furthermore, QuanTraffic develops an adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts the prediction interval based on the location and prediction window of the test input. We evaluated QuanTraffic by applying it to five representative DNN models for traffic forecasting across seven public datasets. We then compared QuanTraffic against six uncertainty quantification methods. Compared to the baseline uncertainty modeling techniques, QuanTraffic with base DNN architectures delivers consistently better and more robust performance than the existing ones on the reported datasets.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - It is a challenging task to achieve the minimum average CCT (coflow completion time) and provide isolation guarantees in multi-tenant datacenters without prior knowledge of coflow sizes. State-of-the-art solutions either focus on minimizing the average CCT or providing optimal isolation guarantees. However, achieving the minimum average CCT and isolation guarantees in multi-tenant datacenters is difficult due to the conflicting nature of these objectives. Therefore, we propose FIGCS-TF (Fast and Isolation Guarantees Coflow Scheduling via Traffic Forecasting), a coflow scheduling algorithm that does not require prior knowledge. FIGCS-TF utilizes a lightweight forecasting module to predict the relative scheduling priority of coflows. Moreover, it employs the MDRF (monopolistic dominant resource fairness) strategy for bandwidth allocation, which is based on super-coflows and helps achieve long-term isolation. Through trace-driven simulations, FIGCS-TF demonstrate communication stages that are 1.12×, 1.99×, and 5.50× faster than DRF (Dominant Resource Fairness), NCDRF (Non-Clairvoyant Dominant Resource Fairness) and Per-Flow Fairness, respectively. In comparison with the theoretically minimum CCT, FIGCS-TF experiences only a 46% increase in average CCT at the top 95th percentile of the dataset. Overall, FIGCS-TF exhibits superior performance in reducing average CCT compared to other algorithms. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Short-term traffic flow forecasting is a hot issue in the field of intelligent transportation. The research field of traffic forecasting has evolved greatly in past decades. With the rapid development of deep learning and neural networks, a series of effective methods have been proposed to address the short-term traffic flow forecasting problem, which makes it possible to examine and forecast traffic situations more accurately than ever. Different from linear based methods, deep learning based methods achieve traffic flow forecasting by exploring the complex nonlinear relationships in traffic flow. Most existing methods always use a single framework for feature extraction and forecasting only. These approaches treat all traffic flow equally and consider them contain same attribute. However, the traffic flow from different time spots or roads may contain distinct attributes information (such as congested and uncongested). A simple single framework usually ignore the different attributes embedded in different distributions of data. This would decrease the accuracy of traffic forecasting. To tackle these issues, we propose an adaptive composite framework, named Long-Short-Combination (LSC). In the proposed method, two data forecasting modules(L and S) are designed for short-term traffic flow with different attributes respectively. Furthermore, we also integrate an attribute forecasting module (C) to forecast the traffic attributes for each time point in future time series. The proposed framework has been assessed on real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has excellent forecasting performance. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - To meet increasing traffic requirements in mobile networks, small base stations (SBSs) are densely deployed, overlapping existing network architecture and increasing system capacity. However, densely deployed SBSs increase energy consumption and interference. Although these problems already exist because of densely deployed SBSs, even more SBSs are needed to meet increasing traffic demands. Hence, base station (BS) switching operations have been used to minimize energy consumption while guaranteeing quality-of-service (QoS) for users. In this study, to optimize energy efficiency, we propose the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to create a BS switching operation strategy with a traffic prediction model. First, a federated long short-term memory (LSTM) model is introduced to predict user traffic demands from user trajectory information. Next, the DRL-based BS switching operation scheme determines the switching operations for the SBSs using the predicted traffic demand. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency, signal-to-interference noise ratio, handover metrics, and prediction performance. 1225-6463/$ © 2024 ETRI.

AB  - The intensive development of road transport has resulted in a significant increase in air pollution. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in urban areas. This creates the need for analyses and forecasts of the scale and extent of future emissions of harmful substances into the environment. The aim of this study was to estimate the costs of the emission of toxic components of exhaust gases generated by all users of conventionally propelled vehicles travelling on a section of urban road in the next 25 years. The traffic study was carried out on an urban traffic route, playing a key role for road transport in the dimension of a given urban agglomeration. The traffic forecast for the analysed road section was based on the results of our own measurements carried out in April 2023 and external data from the General Directorate for Roads and Motorways. The results of the observations concerned six categories of vehicles for the morning and afternoon rush hours. Based on the data obtained, the generic structure of the vehicle population on the analysed section and the average daily traffic were determined. Using the methodology contained in the Blue Book of Road Infrastructure, parameters were calculated in the form of annual indicators of traffic growth on the analysed section, travel speed, and annual air pollution costs for selected vehicle categories, remembering at the same time that the Blue Book-based methodology does not distinguish between unit costs in relation to the type of emissions. The results of the study confirmed that there was an increase in the cost of toxic emissions for each vehicle category over the projected 25-year period. The largest increases were seen for trucks with trailers and passenger cars. In total, for all vehicle categories, emission costs nearly doubled from 2024 to 2046, from EUR 3,745,229 to EUR 7,443,384, due to the doubling of the number of vehicles resulting from the traffic forecast. The analyses presented here provide an answer to the question of what pollution costs may be faced by cities in which road transport will continue to be based on conventional types of propulsion. In addition, the research presented can be used to develop urban mobility transformation plans for the coming years, within the scope of the widely promoted smart city concept and the idea of electromobility, by pointing out to local authorities the direct economic benefits of these changes. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate prediction of road traffic conditions is essential for the effectiveness of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and the advancement of smart cities. While existing methodologies mainly focus on the complex structures of road networks and consider factors like weather, holidays, and accidents, the impact of social events is often overlooked. Queries, representing user requests in navigation applications, offer valuable insights into the popularity of social events and their effects on the road network. In this paper, we introduce the Query-aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Convolution Network (QA-STGACN), which utilizes query data to model the impacts of events and forecast traffic conditions. Initially, spatial and temporal blocks are developed to extract spatial dependencies among road segments and capture traffic dynamics. A dynamic query-aware graph constructor then adaptively learns and retains periodic interactions between road segments and queries. Furthermore, three novel query-aware blocks – convolution, attention, and pattern transformation – are designed to uncover hidden dependencies between traffic conditions and query counts during events, as well as to model the delayed impacts of these counts on traffic. Ultimately, a gated fusion mechanism integrates the spatio-temporal correlations in road networks with the representations derived from queries. Comprehensive experiments on six datasets validate the superiority of QA-STGACN over robust baselines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the increasingly complex urban transportation landscape, the necessity for accurate, multi-step forecasting has never been more apparent to help plan for long-term, strategic transportation initiatives like Intelligent Transportation Systems. This work focuses on resolving uncertainties around the proper training step size for machine learning models performing multi-step traffic flow forecasting. Two strategies are considered: one-step and horizon-step training sizes, which extend from the single-step forecasting method. This paper compares and evaluates two machine learning models: the Support Vector Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Data from two country road locations, including urban roads in Kuala Lumpur and the I5-North freeway in California, are employed to forecast traffic flow in 1-hour increments, projecting from 2 h up to 24 h ahead. The results reveal a significant difference in performance between the two training step sizes, with the one-step training size emerging as the more consistent and optimal strategy for both Direct and Multi-Input Multi-Output forecasting strategies. The proposed model, the Direct Particle Swarm Optimization Grid Search Support Vector Regression (Direct-PSOGS-SVR) model, exhibited comparable or slightly better performance than the LSTM model in both environments. In the I5-North freeway dataset, the Direct-PSOGS-SVR achieved similar Root Mean Squared Error values across most forecasting tasks compared to the LSTM, indicating its effectiveness in stable traffic flow patterns. Notably, in the more dynamic urban environment of Kuala Lumpur, the Direct-PSOGS-SVR model also demonstrated stability and resilience in forecasting accuracy, effectively handling the inherent noise and fluctuations in traffic patterns. These findings serve as a valuable guide for practitioners in selecting the most efficacious combination of training strategies for specific time series forecasting tasks utilizing machine learning models, particularly in traffic flow forecasting. Introducing the Direct-PSOGS-SVR model enriches the landscape of machine learning solutions for traffic forecasting, underscoring the paper's contributions to the broader understanding of time series forecasting dynamics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) provide a feasible method for modeling complex spatiotemporal dependencies during mobile traffic forecasting. However, most existing studies have adopted spatial node clustering methods to construct a coarsened graph that overlooks the temporal correlation within the original station graph. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art methods fail to fully exploit the cross-regional feature impacts on stations, which limits their ability to model nonlocal spatial dependency. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence (HSeq2Seq) approach that combines HGNNs with a sequence-to-sequence architecture (Seq2Seq) for mobile traffic forecasting. First, a spatiotemporal node clustering method was designed to construct the hierarchical structure. Second, a convolution encoder was employed to extract the local spatiotemporal features from a hierarchical perspective, and a novel attention-based feature fusion module was built to capture the nonlocal spatiotemporal features by identifying both the intra- and cross-regional feature impacts on the stations. Finally, a recurrent decoder is introduced to reweight the spatiotemporal features and recursively produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while the ablation study also verifies the effectiveness of the spatiotemporal node clustering and the attention-based feature fusion module. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Understanding the movement of objects through spatio-temporal data is important for timely interventions in complex areas related to human mobility and the trajectories of moving objects. The spatio-temporal data forms the basis for the development of applications in mobility management that have an influence on every aspect of human life and object tracking. With latitude, longitude, and time data, continuous mobility tracking is possible and provides very valuable insights for applications that depend on unique mobility characteristics. Mobility data supports many research studies and predictive applications. This includes travel behavior analysis, geomatic applications, and transportation system evaluations. It is very important for analysis in human mobility data since it will be critical to epidemic modeling and traffic prediction in which there is a requirement of quantitative models that would reflect the statistical patterns of individual trajectories. Such models add up to urban planning, traffic forecasting, location-based services, and modeling pandemic spread. Semantically annotated regions are integrated for enrichment of meaningful attributes over trajectories data; this results in an attribute-enriched trajectory. This study also includes the SemTraClus algorithm [6] to cluster and prioritize semantic regions within spatio-temporal trajectories, The performance is analyzed by comparing DBSCAN clusterings with K-means and BIRCH methods, and the evaluation made will be also based on weightage participation of users and Silhouette scores. GeoLife Trajectory Dataset from Microsoft Research Asia [18] is used in the purpose. © 2024 ISCA.

AB  - This paper investigates traffic forecasting, which attempts to forecast the future state of traffic based on historical situations. This problem has received ever-increasing attention in various scenarios and facilitated the development of numerous downstream applications such as urban planning and transportation management. However, the efficacy of existing methods remains sub-optimal due to their tendency to model temporal and spatial relationships independently, thereby inadequately accounting for complex high-order interactions of both worlds. Moreover, the diversity of transitional patterns in traffic forecasting makes them challenging to capture for existing approaches, warranting a deeper exploration of their diversity. Toward this end, this paper proposes Conjoint Spatio-Temporal graph neural network (abbreviated as COOL), which models heterogeneous graphs from prior and posterior information to conjointly capture high-order spatio-temporal relationships. On the one hand, heterogeneous graphs connecting sequential observation are constructed to extract composite spatio-temporal relationships via prior message passing. On the other hand, we model dynamic relationships using constructed affinity and penalty graphs, which guide posterior message passing to incorporate complementary semantic information into node representations. Moreover, to capture diverse transitional properties to enhance traffic forecasting, we propose a conjoint self-attention decoder that models diverse temporal patterns from both multi-rank and multi-scale views. Experimental results on four popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed COOL provides state-of-the-art performance compared with the competitive baselines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In response to escalating congestion and deteriorating air quality in urban centers worldwide, exacerbated by overburdened transportation systems, there is an urgent need for accurate traffic forecasting and effective sustainable urban development strategies. This study employs agent-based modeling through four distinctive scenarios for Tehran, I. R. Iran. A synthetic population is meticulously crafted using simulated annealing, enabling the emulation of daily commuting patterns. Results show that by bolstering cycling infrastructure and enhancing public transportation services, reliance on private cars is reduced up to 46%. The introduction of flexible working hours reduces the traffic volumes during peak traffic hours by 47% and significantly altering the daily distances traveled by personal cars, as evidenced by a 1:6 ratio in car volume increase between scenarios emphasizing flexible working hours and those with more conventional traffic patterns. The results provide powerful insights for decisionmakers to manage the traffic especially in high polluted air conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Congestion in large and growing cities is a significant issue that harms the economy, travelers, and the ecosystem. Forecasting the degree of congestion on a road network in advance can help to avoid it and boost the network's capacity and performance. Despite its importance, however, traffic congestion prediction is not a popular topic among researchers and traffic engineers. It's because there aren't enough effective computational traffic forecast techniques or high-quality citywide traffic data. In the existing works, there are several Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are developed for the prediction of traffic congestion in the transport networks. Yet, it facing the problems and challenges relevant to the following parameters: ineffective data handling, prediction error, high time for training and testing operations. Therefore, the proposed work aims to implement a novel AI model for accurately forecasting the traffic congestion in the transportation networks. Here, the Cascaded Transition Recurrent Feature Network (CTRFN) technique is used to extract the best and useful features related to congestion from the traffic dataset. After that, the Paramount Transfer Learning Network (PTLN) model is deployed to predict the traffic congestion based on the extracted features. During this process, the Coherent Lizard Search Optimization (CLSO) algorithm is used to compute the weight factor for constructing the covariance matrix, which supports to obtain the reduced prediction error outputs. Moreover, the congestion prediction performance of the proposed model is validated and compared by using different measures. © 2024

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a crucial task for enhancing the quality and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. In recent years, several neural networks have been proposed to tackle this challenge. However, traffic data itself has complex composition and intertwined temporal patterns. Currently, the absence of effective methods to capture the inherent properties and overall profile of traffic data has become a bottleneck in improving the traffic prediction capabilities of models. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model, Decomposition with Feature Attention and Graph Convolution Network (DFAGCN), for Traffic Forecasting. To highlight the inherent properties of complicated traffic data, we present a unique Decomposition with Feature Attention (DFA) method to decompose the traffic data into seasonality, trend, and remainder. On the one hand, we introduce a new method to filter out noise and possible outliers from time series data. On the other hand, we employ an attention mechanism to make our decomposition method adaptively extract the trend. Subsequently, we utilize spatial–temporal attention to simulate the dynamic spatial–temporal correlations of traffic data. Finally, we use spatial–temporal convolution to extract local dependencies of traffic data. Experiments conducted on four real-world traffic forecasting datasets demonstrate that DFAGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results show that the application of time series decomposition to traffic data significantly enhances the accuracy of traffic prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in spatiotemporal predictive learning, with methods incorporating auxiliary inputs, complex neural architectures, and sophisticated training strategies. While SimVP has introduced a simpler, CNN-based baseline for this task, it still relies on heavy Unet-like architectures for spatial and temporal modeling, which still suffers from high complexity and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose SimVPv2, a streamlined model that eliminates the need for Unet architectures and demonstrates that plain stacks of convolutional layers, enhanced with an efficient Gated Spatiotemporal Attention mechanism, can deliver state-of-the-art performance. SimVPv2 not only simplifies the model architecture but also improves both performance and computational efficiency. On the standard Moving MNIST benchmark, SimVPv2 achieves superior performance compared to SimVP, with fewer FLOPs, about half the training time, and 60% faster inference efficiency. Extensive experiments across eight diverse datasets, including real-world tasks such as traffic forecasting and climate prediction, further demonstrate that SimVPv2 offers a powerful yet straightforward solution, achieving robust generalization across various spatiotemporal learning scenarios. We believe the proposed SimVPv2 can serve as a solid baseline to benefit the spatiotemporal predictive learning community.  © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is an increasingly important research topic in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In this field, prediction models based on Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) have become very popular. Most GCN-based models focus on constructing various optimized or dynamic road network graphs to represent the spatio-temporal correlation hidden in traffic data. However, these methods currently only consider the construction of a single improved road network graph and ignore the relationship of these existing optimized road network graphs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Contrastive Optimized Graph Convolution Network (COGCN) to connect two kinds of optimized road network graphs and maintain their global–local feature consistency through contrastive learning. The proposed COGCN model is evaluated in detail using four real traffic datasets: two traffic speed datasets and two traffic flow datasets. Experimental results show that COGCN improves forecasting accuracy by at least 2% on the two speed datasets and 9% on the two flow datasets compared to the existing state-of-the-art GCN-based methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nowadays, an accurate and reliable traffic forecast is meaningful in making the right decisions for traffic management systems in vehicular environments. Nevertheless, traffic flow prediction is a significant challenge in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) that has taken much attention. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid traffic prediction model based on Prophet model and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM), called Hyper-Flophet, to predict next traffic flow. Hyper-Flophet model adopts the traditional neural prophet model but with major parameter tuning. First, we propose an efficient algorithm for predicting the traffic flow trend then, we develop an interactive LSTM (I-LSTM) model for auto-regression components. After that, we implement a new future regressor component called network mobility and finally, we enhance the event and holiday component by introducing exponential growth term. Through simulations with real VANET data, we show that the proposed hybrid approach can achieve superior forecasting performance over other models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intelligent transportation system integration is becoming increasingly dependent on robust and energy-efficient protocols for communication between vehicles and infrastructure (V2V and V2I) networks. This study offers an energy-efficient cluster-based routing protocol for interaction between V2V and V2I, with a focus on traffic forecasting. To improve communication efficiency in dynamic vehicle contexts, the protocol makes use of the capabilities of vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANETs). A novel approach is provided to optimize the routing process and meet the issues posed by variable traffic situations. The suggested method combines two advanced hybrid optimization algorithms: The Adaptive Binary Bird Swarm Optimization Algorithm (ABBSOA) and the Adaptive Golden Eagle Optimization Algorithm (AGEOA). The goal of hybridizing these algorithms is to capitalize on their complementary capabilities, resulting in a synergistic impact that improves the protocol’s adaptability and efficiency. Through its feeding, guarding, and flying imitation behaviors, ABBSOA, inspired by the collective behaviors of birds, focuses on global optimization, outperforming local optima. The golden eagle hunting patterns served as inspiration for AGEOA, which introduces indirect and direct effects for improved convergence and solution quality. For efficient communication management, the protocol adopts a cluster-based design, with cluster heads (CHs) dynamically determined using the hybrid optimization algorithm. The ABBSOA-AGEOA-based strategy improves the CH selection process by optimizing job distribution among less burdened CHs in changing traffic circumstances. The simulation results indicate that the proposed cluster-based energy-efficient. The routing protocol performs better than current protocols with regard to traffic forecasting accuracy, packet delivery rate (PDR), packet loss rate (PLR), throughput, network lifetime (NLT), cluster lifetime, cluster build time, and energy consumption end-to-end latency. Comparative simulations demonstrate the suggested method’s advantage over current VANET routing techniques like SFSR, ICMFO, and FA-OLSR, as shown by metrics using the proposed systems ABBSOA and AGEOA, which work well together to get through the complicated networks of vehicles. This makes the protocol a new way for V2V and V2I to communicate in smart transportation systems that will last for a long time. © 2024 Institute of Information Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) routing in smart cities is planned and maintained based on vehicle communication, demands, and terminal interaction. The influencing factors, such as road and traffic conditions, demand a prior conjecture to improve transportation, navigation comfort, and efficiency. Therefore, a Conjecture Interaction Optimization Model using terminal-communication assistance is introduced in this article. This model accounts for the road's physical condition and traffic density for setting up routing efficiency. The priorities are dynamic and based on the nearest assisting/ communicating terminal to improve the forecast on dynamic vehicle routing. The routing and traffic avoidance decisions are pursued using reciprocated multi-instance convergence learning (RMICL). RMICL algorithm optimizes real-time vehicle communication to analyze the vehicles' active and discarded interactions for minimum delay and route refinement. The MIL algorithm integrates multi-instance learning into the interaction labelling process, enhancing the routing prediction by differentiating between reliable and erroneous data. It considers improved traffic avoidance and ensuring convergence robustness in dynamic traffic management for smart cities. The convergence optimization is used to identify the low latency route decision outcomes from the communicating terminal. The routing identifies the possible combination of available interacting terminals with precision traffic forecast; the convergence must be slight between the conjecture and the actual routing traffic. Contrarily, reverse convergence instances identify traffic locations based on discarded interactions. The process is iterated from low traffic to highly interactive route searches based on location. Therefore, the characteristics of conjectures are updated with the forward and reverse reciprocation instances. This model leverages the ITS decision convergence over traffic and routing efficiencies. The results of the proposed model are identified as follows: this model improves traffic detection by 10.76% through 11.67% high interaction throughput to reduce 12.66% travel time for the distance-covered variant.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is a crucial component of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) with substantial implications for traffic management and daily travel. While short-term traffic forecasting has shown promise, long-term prediction presents unique challenges. The existing short-term approaches fall short in long-term scenarios due to two primary issues: (1) ignoring modeling the interaction relationships among dynamic spatial dependencies, and (2) extracting long-term temporal dependencies without capturing the time information in-depth. To mitigate the above issues, we propose a novel model called TADGCN, a Time-Aware Dynamic Graph Convolution Network, to effectively perform long-term traffic flow prediction. TADGCN captures latent interactions among dynamic spatial dependencies using Attention-Driven Dynamic Adaptive Graph Convolution Network (ADAGCN) modules. The time-aware capability is effectively enhanced using Time-Aware Joint Multi-View Temporal Encoder (TJMTE) modules due to the construction of a time-aware matrix. We conduct diversified experiments on three real-world datasets (England, PEMS04, and PEMS08) to evaluate the performance of our proposed method TADGCN. The results reveal that TADGCN achieves the best accuracy in all cases against 16 competitive state-of-the-art baselines. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The growing need for applications with low latency and high bandwidth in 5G networks has shifted the emphasis towards integrating edge computing into mobile network architectures. The optimal deployment of edge servers (ESs) is crucial for balancing performance and cost. Current research primarily focuses on the optimal deployment of ESs. However, there is limited attention on forecasting the workload of ESs, particularly in scenarios where they are placed in their optimal positions, which is crucial for accommodating anticipated variations in user densities and workload fluctuations expected in the near future. This research forecasting of workload in 5G networks by leveraging the Temporal Hierarchical Attention Mechanism Network (THAMNET) model for accurate Internet traffic forecasting. Addressing this gap, the Max–Min Fairness Allocation Scheme (MMF-AS) algorithm is implemented to ensure a balanced workload distribution. This approach facilitates fair allocation of Base Stations (BSs) to ESs, taking into account factors such as workload, distance, and connectivity. A novel approach is introduced by integrating the THAMNET forecasting model with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and MMF-AS algorithms. The proposed method considers predicted future traffic demands, and connectivity between ESs and BSs, and aims to achieve balanced workload distribution, higher utilisation rates, minimised latency, and reduced energy consumption. Experimental results demonstrate equitable workload distribution 25.95%, utilisation rate 17.57%, and notable reductions in latency 47.61% and energy consumption 32.28% compared to the non-forecasting comparison. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Traffic forecasting stands as a cornerstone in urban planning, yet existing methods mainly fall short in capturing long-term spatio-temporal patterns. To be specific, various exquisite modules are designed in current works, while bringing heavy computing costs with the length of historical data. Furthermore, any replacement or reintegration of modules could weaken final performance, and the whole model needs to be trained from scratch on different datasets. To address the above shortcomings, inspired by pre-training methodologies, we introduce a novel Pre-trained Spatio-Temporal Network (PreSTNet), a two-phase framework comprising pre-training and fine-tuning. In the first pre-training phase, PreSTNet undertakes a data masking and recovery task, which is facilitated through a dedicated long sequence embedding module and an encoder–decoder structure with temporal attention layers and graph convolution operators. The recovery task involves masking several data, forcing the model to capture correlations between unmasked data and finally recover the masked part, which facilitates the extraction of long-term spatio-temporal features from extensive data. The second phase involves freezing the learned parameters and replacing the decoder with a forecasting header. This header, designed as a meta-learning fusion module and spatio-temporal convolution layers, can integrate long-term and short-term traffic data, and is trained in the manner of supervised learning to suit the target task. Rigorous experiments on real-world datasets underscore the superiority of PreSTNet. Further case studies reveal that the pre-trained encoder, coupled with an intuitive linear regression, achieves comparable performance to advanced methods. These findings affirm the robust capabilities of the proposed PreSTNet in addressing the complexities of traffic forecasting. © 2024

The proposed model integrates multi-layer graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to address dependencies in temporal and spatial traffic dynamics. Specifically, ISTGCN integrates graph convolutional layers and convolutional sequence learning layers within multiple spatiotemporal convolutional blocks. For capturing the temporal aspect, predictive graph modeling for road network traffic at particular time stamps is performed. To integrate the spatial information, graph convolution operations are applied. The proposed model was validated on real-life datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that ISTGCN achieves significantly lower error values across key metrics—RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting has become a core component of Intelligent Transportation Systems. However, accurate traffic forecasting is very challenging, caused by the complex traffic road networks. Most existing forecasting methods do not fully consider the topological structure information of road networks, making it difficult to extract accurate spatial features. In addition, spatial and temporal features have different impacts on traffic conditions, but the existing studies ignore the distribution of spatial-temporal features in traffic regions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph neural network architecture named Attention-based Spatial-Temporal Adaptive Integration Gated Network (AST-AIGN). The originality of AST-AIGN is to obtain a spatial feature that more accurately reflects the topological structure of the road networks by embedding Graph Attention Network (GAT) into Jumping Knowledge Net (JK-Net). We propose a data-dependent function called spatial-temporal adaptive integration gate to process the diversity of feature distribution and highlight features in road networks that significantly affects traffic conditions. We evaluate our model on two real-world traffic datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PEMS04 and PEMS08), and the extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed AST-AIGN architecture outperforms other baselines. © 2024 – IOS Press.

AB  - A sustainable city is a smart city with a minimal impact on the environment, by incorporating technologies to reduce pollution. Traffic congestion which is a major concern contributes to global warming and climate change. Traffic forecasting projects future traffic patterns, using historical and current data to enhance traffic flow management. We propose a whole novel approach for predicting traffic congestion rate based on air quality data. We developed a new ensemble voting model based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Polynomial Regression (PolReg) models that use a new voting thresholded algorithm instead of the existing voting ones. The hyperparameters were optimized with the Genetic Agorithm, to overcome the non-stationarity of time series. A comparative study with the literature confirmed that our framework outperforms existing researches by keeping an absolute effectiveness according to learning curves, with Mean Absolute Error of 0.04, R-Squared of 0.93, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.05. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Nowadays, various disturbances in urban transportation data acquisition/processing/storage lead to the inevitable data missing problem, which undermines the valuable traffic information and greatly threats the reliability of existing benchmark traffic prediction models. Inspired from the powerful generative learning ability of GANs, we propose an integrated spatiotemporal Data imputation Graph Attention Generative Adversarial Networks (Di-GraphGAN) for accurate and efficient spatial-temporal traffic forecasting under data missing scenarios. Specifically, we first propose a traffic data imputation module named DI-LSTM, which adopts the architecture of LSTM Network with an extra Time Damping unit to accurately estimating the missing values. Then, we facilitate Di-GraphGAN with an original developed Task-Efficient Graph Attention Networks (TE-GAT) for better graph representation learning and a Temporal Contextual Attention (TCA) mechanism to capture the dynamic spatiotemporal traffic patterns. Finally, extensive evaluations are conducted on two real-world traffic speed datasets from China, demonstrating that Di-GraphGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in both traffic forecasting and spatiotemporal data imputation tasks. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Traffic forecasting problems involve jointly modeling the non-linear spatio-Temporal dependencies at different scales. While graph neural network models have been effectively used to capture the non-linear spatial dependencies, capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies between the locations remains a major challenge. The errors in capturing such dependencies propagate in modeling the temporal dependencies between the locations, thereby severely affecting the performance of long-Term predictions. While transformer-based mechanisms have been recently proposed for capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies, these methods are susceptible to fluctuations in data brought on by unforeseen events like traffic congestion and accidents. To mitigate these issues we propose an improvised spatio-Temporal parallel transformer (STPT) based model for traffic prediction that uses multiple adjacency graphs passed through a pair of coupled graph transformer-convolution network units, operating in parallel, to generate more noise-resilient embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 real-world traffic datasets and compare the performance of STPT with several state-of-The-Art baselines, in terms of measures like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. We find that using STPT improves the performance by around as compared to the baselines. We also investigate the applicability of the model on other spatio-Temporal data in other domains. We use a Covid-19 dataset to predict the number of future occurrences in different regions from a given set of historical occurrences. The results demonstrate the superiority of our model for such datasets.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Traffic forecasting technology has widespread applications in various domains, such as urban traffic planning and intelligent transportation systems. Traffic forecasting encounters challenges in effectively capturing the intricate spatial–temporal correlations in traffic data. While the latest methods have achieved satisfactory performance, they still suffer from two limitations: (i) Most methods overlook the memory of valuable traffic patterns at each traffic node, thus making it struggle to reveal dynamic spatial–temporal correlations using their inherent periodicity and trend characteristics from a broader perspective. (ii) As the research progresses, recently proposed models become increasingly complex and massive. To address these issues, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Memory Transformer (STAMT) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose a memory bank to enhance vanilla spatial attention and cache the traffic patterns of historical input. By querying these traffic patterns, which contain rich spatial–temporal semantic information, the model can optimize prediction performance by extracting trends and regularities across various periods. To reduce the computational costs, we introduce a temporal module to capture temporal correlations while reducing temporal dimension information. In addition, we leverage the random feature map and matrix multiplication associativity property, which reduce the quadratic complexity of spatial attention to linearity with regard to the number of nodes. Ultimately, our theoretical analysis concludes that a single-layer spatial attention network is sufficient to capture spatial–temporal correlations deeply without stacking. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that STAMT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in regular, long-range, and large-scale traffic forecasting tasks while significantly reducing the computational costs.

AB  - Accurate traffic flow data are important for congestion identification and real-time traffic control. Raw traffic flow data may be disturbed by different noises during the acquisition process, which leads to the degradation of model prediction performance. To address this problems, this paper proposes a data denoising method based on the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) combined with wavelet threshold denoising (WTD) to suppress potential outliers in the data, and then introduces functional principal component analysis to accomplish the traffic forecasting task. We use the proposed framework for real traffic flow prediction and validate the prediction performance of the proposed framework using root mean square error and mean absolute error. In the prediction performance comparison, five denoising methods are considered: empirical mode decomposition (EMD), ensemble empirical mode decomposition, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, ICEEMDAN, and WTD. The prediction results show that the model combined with the denoising method outperforms the model without the denoising method. ICEEMDAN combined with WTD’s denoising method improves prediction performance more than other methods. Furthermore, the WTD method with dmey type achieves higher accuracy than other types. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Public-private partnerships are an important tool for infrastructure development, but variability in bids can undermine value for money. This study investigated bid variability in India's initial two auction road assets under the Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) model. A comparative case study research design was utilized involving an in-depth analysis of the TOT I and TOT II auctions. Data was gathered from project reports, guidelines, news articles, stakeholder interviews, and then thematically analyzed. The analysis revealed substantial bid variability within and between the auctions. The findings showed bid variability within the auctions depended on the information gaps owing to the timing and quality of the information released by the auctioneer, the tender conditions and tender process, potential value enhancement and securitization of assets by the bidders, heterogeneous bidder objectives across asset types, and strategic bidding assumptions. The bid variability between the TOT I and TOT II auctions depended on asset quality, declared reserve price, sociopolitical factors, and the prevailing business conditions. While TOT I road quality and growth prospects encouraged strong bidding, overpricing, shifting business scenarios, and political uncertainty in TOT II states depressed bids below expectations. Results indicated that transparency around asset characteristics and traffic forecasts enables realistic bid assessments to control variability. It can inform bid rationalization and pricing mechanisms for future auctions of public infrastructure. Setting reserve prices reflecting project specifics also helped anchor bid ranges. Attracting larger bidder pools countered the influence of overly optimistic/pessimistic valuations. Gradual expansion into new geographies allowed adaptive policy learning. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Efficient and effective multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is critical for real-world applications, such as traffic management and energy dispatching. Most of the current deep learning studies (e.g., Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and Transformers) fall short in a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Existing MTS forecasting studies have yet to fully and simultaneously address issues such as modelling both temporal and variate dependencies, as well as the temporal locality, hindering broader applications. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model, i.e., Time Series MLP (TSP). TSP is built upon MLP and relies on the PrecMLP with the proposed computationally free Precurrent mechanism to model both the variate dependency and temporal locality, thus being simple, effective and versatile. Extensive experiments show that TSP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 16 datasets for both Long-term Time-series Forecasting and Traffic Forecasting tasks. Furthermore, it attains a significant reduction of at least 95.97% in practical training speed on the CPU. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic forecasting, as the cornerstone of the development of intelligent transportation systems, plays a crucial role in facilitating accurate control and management of urban traffic. By treating sensors as nodes in a road network, recent research on modeling complex spatial-temporal graph structures has achieved notable advancements in traffic forecasting. However, limited by the increasing number of sensors and recorded data points, most of the recent studies on spatial-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) research concentrate on aggregating short-term (e.g. recent one-hour) traffic history to predict future data. Furthermore, almost all previous STGNNs neglect to incorporate the cyclical patterns that appear in the traffic historical data. For example, the cyclical patterns of traffic on the same day or hour of each week can help improve the accuracy of future traffic predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Granularity Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (DmgSTGAT) framework for traffic forecasting, which leverages multi-granularity spatial-temporal correlations across different time-scales and variables to efficiently consider cyclical patterns in traffic data. We also design effective temporal encoding and transformer encoding layers to produce meaningful multi-granularity sensor-level, day-level, hour-level, and point-level representations. The multi-granularity spatial-temporal graph attention network can use the produced representations to extract useful but sparsely distributed patterns accurately, which also avoids the influence of extra noise from the long-term history. Experimental results on four real-world traffic datasets show that DmgSTGAT can achieve state-of-the-art performance with the help of multi-granularity cyclical patterns compared with various recent baselines. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This work addresses the challenge of forecasting temporal metrics that characterize cellular traffic behavior. The ultimate goal is to provide network operators with a valuable tool for modeling mobile network traffic and optimizing connected resources. The idea is to estimate beforehand the temporal evolution of some Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) metrics, which is helpful for accurately tuning the allocation of network resources. Remarkably, these metrics (expressed as time series) are typically correlated, and changes in one time series can affect others in a variety of ways and to different extents. For example, high network delay (a QoS-related metric) is associated with degradation in voice quality over time (a QoE-related metric). Accordingly, we address the problem of cellular traffic forecasting with correlated time series, proposing three innovative hybrid learning strategies designed by combining the advantages of two approaches: (i) a statistical approach, implemented through the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, which encodes each metric as a combination of past values of the same metric along with a combination of values of other related metrics, resulting in a multivariate structure; and (ii) an approach based on deep learning techniques (specifically, CNN, LSTM, and GRU) which operate on such a multivariate structure to perform the forecasting. The resulting performance demonstrates the benefits of the proposed hybrid schemes (VAR-CNN, VAR-LSTM, VAR-GRU) over their pure counterparts, with a significant reduction in forecasting errors. The network metrics were gathered in a real urban cellular environment, where the presence of exogenous factors (e.g., interferences, weather conditions, etc.) makes the forecasting assessment particularly challenging. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Providing both point estimation and uncertainty quantification for traffic forecasting is crucial for supporting accurate and reliable services in intelligent transportation systems. However, the majority of existing traffic forecasting works mainly focus on point estimation without quantifying the uncertainty of predictions. Meanwhile, existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods fail to capture the inherent static characteristics of traffic uncertainty along both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Directly equipping the traffic forecasting works with uncertainty quantification techniques may even damage the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic forecasting model aiming at providing point estimation and uncertainty quantification simultaneously, called STUP. Compared to the traditional graph convolution networks (GCNs), our framework is able to incorporate uncertainty quantification into traffic forecasting to further improve forecasting performance. Specifically, we first develop an adaptive strategy to initialize uncertainty distribution. Then a kind of spatial–temporal uncertainty layer is carefully designed to model the evolution process of both the traffic state and its corresponding uncertainty, along with a gated adjusting unit to avoid error information propagation. Finally, we propose a novel constraint loss to further help improve the forecasting accuracy and to alleviate the training difficulty caused by the lack of uncertainty labels. Experiments on five real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STUP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both the traffic prediction task and uncertainty quantification task. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The emerging 5G network has been revolutionizing the data transfer across the networks. Recently, advanced technologies transform the healthcare industry. With the emergence of 5G technology, smart and ubiquitous healthcare systems are interconnected with high speed and low latency. As ubiquitous healthcare applications require stringent network requirements, managing network traffic and resources becomes difficult. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices generates a large volume and variety of data, including physiological signals, images, and videos. As many medical applications require real-time communication and data transfer, this puts high demands on the network, which needs handle low latency, high availability, and high reliability. Achieving consistent QoS is challenging due to the inherent limitations of conventional methods which are susceptible to network congestion and latency issues. The next generation of Software Defined Networking (SDN) in IoMT can play a vital role in supporting traffic management. Reliable classification and forecasting will enable the SDN controller to make optimal routing decisions dynamically. Therefore in this paper, a novel Medical Traffic Forecasting framework based on Weighted Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (MTF-WMSSA) is proposed for an SDN-enabled IoMT healthcare network to analyze and forecast network traffic and ensure accurate real-time medical data transfer. The evaluation was conducted on the EHMS dataset to study the performance of the proposed method. The comparison of the proposed MTF-WMSSA is made with classical methods such as SVR and LSTM. The result shows that the proposed MTF-WMSSA exhibits improved classification accuracy of 93%. The network parameters that are forecasted are average traffic load, average packet arrival rate and average jitter. The MAPE of the multi-step ahead forecast is 13.64 and 11.41 for short and long intervals respectively. The forecasting algorithm proposed in this paper can efficiently determine future flow parameters which help to implement adaptive traffic engineering. The evaluation was conducted on the dataset to study the performance of the proposed method. The result shows that the proposed MTF-WMSSA exhibits better accuracy for multi-step ahead forecast and outperforms the classical methods.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is challenging due to the intricate spatio-temporal correlations in traffic patterns. Previous works captured spatial dependencies based on graph neural networks and used fixed graph construction methods to characterize spatial relationships, which limits the ability of models to capture dynamic and long-range spatial dependencies. Meanwhile, prior studies did not consider the issue of a large number of redundant parameters in traffic prediction models, which not only increases the storage cost of the model but also reduces its generalization ability. To address the above challenges, we propose a Dynamic Spatial Transformer for Traffic Forecasting with Low-Rank Tensor Compression (DSFormer-LRTC). Specifically, we constructed a global spatial Transformer to capture remote spatial dependencies, and a distance-based mask matrix is used in local spatial Transformer to enhance the adjacent spatial influence. To reduce the complexity of the model, the model adopts a design that separates temporal and spatial. Meanwhile, we introduce low-rank tensor decomposition to reconstruct the parameter matrix in Transformer module to compress the proposed model. Experimental results show that DSFormer-LRTC achieves state-of-the-art performance on four real-world datasets. The experimental analysis of attention matrix also proves that the model can learn dynamic and distant spatial features. Finally, the compressed model parameters reduce the original parameter size by two-thirds, while significantly outperforming the baseline model in terms of computational efficiency.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Deep-learning-based data-driven forecasting methods have achieved impressive results for traffic forecasting. Specifically, spatiotemporal graph neural networks have emerged as a promising class of approaches because of their ability to model both spatial and temporal patterns in traffic data. A major limitation of these methods, however, is that they provide forecasts without estimates of data and model uncertainty, which are critical for understanding inherent variations of the data and forecast limitations due to a lack of training data. We develop a scalable deep ensemble approach to quantify data and model uncertainties for spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Our approach consists of four stages: 1) using a Gaussian-Assumption-free simultaneous quantile regression loss for training a spatiotemporal graph neural network to model the traffic distribution; 2) applying a scalable Bayesian optimization method to tune the hyperparameters of the spatiotemporal graph neural network; 3) fitting a Gaussian copula generative model to capture the joint distributions of the high-performing hyperparameter configurations, and training an ensemble of models by sampling a new set of hyperparameter configurations from the generative model; and 4) decomposing the data and model uncertainties from the spatiotemporal graph neural network ensembles. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network, a state-of-The-Art method for short-Term traffic forecasting. We demonstrate the efficacy of our ensemble-based uncertainty quantification method by comparing it with other uncertainty estimation techniques. We show that our generic and scalable approach outperforms the current state-of-The-Art Bayesian and a number of other commonly used frequentist uncertainty estimation techniques.

AB  - The widespread use of machine learning in location-related scenarios is propelling the rapid development of intelligent transportation. To assist users in making more informed travel plans, the demand for improving prediction accuracy is growing. Prior to model training, data cleaning is a common method used to eliminate redundant, erroneous and outlier samples. However, in intelligent transportation, there are serious issues with location awareness and privacy protection of existing data cleaning schemes. Therefore, we propose a location-aware and privacy-preserving data cleaning framework (PriSPA) which provides a cleaned dataset consisting of the samples from adopted data suppliers at qualified locations while ensuring the privacy of locations, spatial constraints and sensitive samples. We combine boolean secret sharing with XOR operations to make sure that it is possible to figure out whether a location complies with spatial constraints without leakage. More specifically, we ensure privacy using key agreement, secret sharing, authenticated encryption and random permutation. We seriously analyze the security of PriSPA and conduct comprehensive experiments to prove its security, effectiveness and efficiency. Based on the comparisons with the raw traffic forecasting framework, we observe that PriSPA improves the precision of the model with 17.6% - 32.7% error reduction. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Hypercomplex numbers, such as quaternions and octonions, have recently gained attention because of their advantageous properties over real numbers, e.g., in the development of parameter-efficient neural networks. For instance, the 16-component sedenion has the capacity to reduce the number of network parameters by a factor of 16. Moreover, hypercomplex neural networks offer advantages in the processing of spatiotemporal data as they are able to represent variable temporal data divisions through the hypercomplex components. Similarly, they support multimodal learning, with each component representing an individual modality. In this article, the key components of deep learning in the hypercomplex domain are introduced, encompassing concatenation, activation functions, convolution, and batch normalization. The use of the backpropagation algorithm for training hypercomplex networks is discussed in the context of hypercomplex algebra. These concepts are brought together in the design of a ResNet backbone using hypercomplex convolution, which is integrated within a U-Net configuration and applied in weather and traffic forecasting problems. The results demonstrate the superior performance of hypercomplex networks compared to their real-valued counterparts, given a fixed parameter budget, highlighting their potential in spatiotemporal data processing. © 1991-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Spatial Temporal Graph Convolution Networks (ST-GCNs) have been proposed to embed spatio-temporal graphs. However, these networks used the Euclidean space as the embedding space which does not exploit the structure of the embedded graphs. Euclidean space has been shown not to be the ideal space for embedding graphs especially with tree-like structures. In this work, we make use of hyperbolic geometry and introduce a compact tangent space-free Lorentz ST-GCN and call it LSTGCN that perform the network operations directly on the manifold without resorting to the tangent space. The network uses spatial and temporal modules to propagate features between adjacent nodes in both, the spatial domain and the temporal domain, respectively. In addition, we introduce an attention module which can automatically determine the similarity of nodes without the need for the graph adjacency matrix. Experiments have been conducted on traffic flow forecasting tasks to show the effectiveness of the proposed compact Lorentz model.  © 1994-2012 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), more and more intelligent applications for ITS have received widespread attention, such as the vehicle detection, inference of typical routes, and traffic forecasting. In these applications, deep learning is widely used as a key artificial intelligence technology. However, most ITS providers fail to collect enough labeled traffic data for model training. As a complement to deep learning, transfer learning is an effective way to solve the scarcity of labeled data, which can transfer knowledge from labeled datasets to unlabeled datasets, thus improving the accuracy of prediction and classification. Nevertheless, when the labeled dataset and the unlabeled dataset are held by different entities, it is still unrealistic for two mutually distrustful entities to cooperate in transfer learning regarding data security and privacy preservation. Although some existing works provide privacy-preserving transfer learning methods, such methods fail to apply to traffic data with high sample dimensions due to their high computational cost and round complexity. To address this problem, we design an efficient privacy-preserving distributed transfer learning protocol, which is appropriate for traffic data. Compared to existing works, our protocol addresses the privacy-preserving problem of transfer learning for traffic data with high sample dimensions. In addition, our protocol has fewer interaction rounds and can be proved in the semi-honest model. Finally, we validate the effectiveness, efficiency and security of the proposed protocol via experiments. Furthermore, we show the application of the proposed protocol in intelligent transportation systems. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Fine-grained traffic forecasting is crucial for the management of urban transportation systems. Road segments and intersection turns, as vital elements of road networks, exhibit heterogeneous spatial structures, yet their traffic states are interconnected due to spatial proximity. The heterogeneity and interrelationships arising from different road network elements pose major challenges to accurate traffic forecasting. However, existing forecasting studies focus solely on bidirectional road segments, disregarding the relationships between roads and turns. To achieve integrated traffic forecasting that considers both road segments and intersection turns, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (STHGFormer). For road network representation, we innovatively define a Heterogeneous Road network Graph (HRG), which provides a comprehensive depiction of the complete traffic network and emphasizes its inherent heterogeneity. Then, we propose a Heterogeneous Spatial Embedding (HSE) module to encode road network information, including heterogeneous attributes and interactions in the HRG. Based on the spatial information encoded by HSE, a unified SpaFormer, serving as the spatial module of STHGFormer, captures the interdependencies between roads and turns across the entire traffic network. To mitigate the impact of high temporal fluctuation, we embed the Adaptive Soft Threshold (AST) module into TempFormer, which dynamically adjusts the threshold to enhance the analysis capability of complex temporal correlations. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from Wuhan, China, demonstrate that STHGFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 6.1 % improvement in road forecasting and an 8.5 % improvement in turn forecasting. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In mobile networks, it is essential to configure networks more efficiently to provide mobile users with services having better quality. For the adjacent cells, sometimes the mobile traffic concentrates in a single cell, leading to traffic imbalance; in many cases, the detection of imbalance is strongly related to the prediction of traffic peaks, which is extremely difficult because many peaks appear suddenly for no apparent reason. To better predict the peaks and traffic imbalance, we propose two novel mobile traffic predictors. The first is a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model which yields significantly better peak prediction along with excellent interpretability by establishing a cooperation mechanism between different experts, whereas the second predictor is a lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) which can obtain similar peak forecasting performance but operating more flexibly and consuming less computational power. The obtained predictions are then used to aid the predictive detection of traffic imbalance. To this end, we first perform a large-scale analysis of mobile traffic and then propose different approaches to detect the future traffic imbalance based on the predictions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, we have conducted extensive experiments on real-world mobile network datasets; all models are implemented in Python 3.8.8 with Pytorch 1.7.0, and they were run on a computer with i7-7700K CPU @ 4.2 GHz running Linux, 64 GB memory and a single Nvidia TITAN X Pascal 12GB GPU. The proposed models are compared with 10 widely used deep learning based predictors, and the results show that our approaches have significantly improved the sensitivity (peak prediction accuracy) from 39.3% to 58.5% (i.e., roughly a 50% increase) along with excellent interpretability. Moreover, the predictions are further used by the predictive detection approach, where the best multi-model approach improves the predictive classification accuracy of congestion (imbalance prediction accuracy) by 10.3% in contrast with the naive approach; this result also verifies the effectiveness of our peak predictions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In complex and volatile transportation traffic situations, accurately forecasting traffic flow can greatly facilitate to manage and plan real-time traffic. However, due to complex road map and traffic conditions, forecasting temporal traffic is a highly challenging task. In literature, most existing works rely on various spatial–temporal models solely built on the topological structure of road networks, to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies of traffic flow at multiple sensing sites. However, besides the road topological relationship, the dynamics of real-world traffic is indispensably affected by the complex but unknown inter-dependency of multiple sites. Based on the above consideration, this paper proposed a novel traffic forecast framework based on multiple-view graph construction and learning, and spatiotemporal graph neural network (STGNN). Specifically, our work’s contributions are following. First, considering transfer entropy (TE)-based relationship graph can characterize the causal influence from one sensing sites to another, the traditional undirected topological graph is transformed into a directed graph through multiplying with the constructed TE relationship graph, which can capture both the topological relationship, and latent casual influence from one site to another, and greatly facilitate to accurately forecast traffic. Meanwhile, a learnable graph matrix is trained to complement the TE-enhanced causality graph. Second, the proposed STGNN-based forecasting framework smoothly integrates recurrent neural network and GNN that works on directional and learnable graphs, so-called DL-GNN. In detail, the aggregation process in DL-GNN is formulated as three parts: aggregation on indegree and outdegree directions of the causality graph, and on learnable graph to fully extract the sites’ representations. The comprehensive experiments on real traffic data demonstrate that our proposal outperforms other state-of-the-art STGNN-based traffic forecasting schemes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Recently, Internet traffic has surged due to the widespread demand for teleworking and flat-rate video distribution services. It is expected that such enormous traffic with diverse patterns will be managed by employing beyond fifth-generation backbone networks, such as satellite networks. Satellite communication resources are scarcer than those of terrestrial communication. Therefore, this study has focused on ensuring efficient satellite network resource operations. Traffic forecasting is a promising approach to facilitate optimal resource allocation. While there are several methods for traffic prediction in terrestrial communication using machine learning, an insufficient number of studies have been conducted regarding satellite communications. Existing traffic prediction approaches consume high bandwidths, which can be a problem for the bandwidth used by users over the limited bandwidth of satellite networks. Therefore, this study proposes a lightweight machine-learning- based traffic prediction method using transfer learning to reduce bandwidth consumption. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method via simulations by comparing its accuracy with conventional approaches.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is a key part of intelligent transport systems, facilitating a variety of urban application services such as trip alerting, route planning and traffic management. However, due to the spatial and temporal correlations of the dynamic, this issue is not well addressed. In this paper, we propose a Multi Scale Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Graph Network (MSSTRG), focusing on local temporal, multi-scale temporal and dynamic spatial correlation. Specifically, we designed a dynamic graph convolution module to model local and global spatial connections in terms of both road distance and adaptive correlation. To capture the non-linear temporal relationship, we model the forward and backward contextual links of the traffic flow sequence using the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Layer. We also replaced the linear layer in the Gated Recurrent unit with a dynamic graph convolution operation to jointly model spatial-temporal correlation. Finally, we propose a temporal fusion layer with multi-scale features to model accurate temporal semantic information from contextual environment with different window sizes, to further obtain accurate prediction results. Experimental results on several traffic datasets show that MSSTRG outperforms the most advanced models and validates the effectiveness of the individual components proposed through ablation study. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - As an essential part of intelligent transportation system (ITS), traffic forecasting has provided crucial role for traffic management and risk assessment. However, complex spatial–temporal dependencies, heterogeneity, dynamicity, and periodicity of traffic data influence the traffic forecasting performance. Consequently, we propose a novel effective gated spatial–temporal merged transformer (GSTMT) inspired by multimask and dual branch for accurate traffic forecasting in this paper. Specifically, we first conduct a concatenation of gated spatial static mask transformer (GSSMT) and gated spatial dynamic mask transformer (GSDMT) with residual network. The GSSMT and GSDMT evolve from the traditional transformer by making preferable modifications that include gated linear unit (GLU), multimask mechanism including static mask matrix (SMM) and dynamic mask matrix (DMM), and spatial attention (SA). Among them, GLU is to promote the performance of capturing spatial dependency, dynamicity, and heterogeneity due to advanced performance for controlling information flow through layers. Additionally, by developing multimask mechanism including two novel SMM and DMM, the proposed GSTMT can precisely model the static and dynamic spatial structure for effectively highlighting static dependency and dynamicity. And SA is injected for enhancing the ability of capturing spatial dependency of GSSMT and GSDMT. Secondly, we develop a dual-branch gated temporal transformer (DBGTT) for capturing temporal dependency, heterogeneity, dynamicity, and periodicity via incorporating the GLU and mixed time series decomposition (MTD) into traditional transformer. Similarly, we also introduce the GLU for empowering DBGTT with capability of capturing temporal dependency, dynamicity, and heterogeneity. In addition, MTD, which brings dual-branch mechanism, can enhance the DBGTT for capturing more detailed temporal information via exploiting global and periodic profile of traffic data. At last, some experiments, which are performed on several real-world traffic datasets, demonstrate the better results over classic traffic forecasting methods. Copyright © 2024 Yongpeng Yang et al.

AB  - Now-a-days since number of vehicles are growing day by day on the roads in urban and metropolitan area, hence traffic jam is becoming very common problem which everyone is facing time to time. So it becomes very crucial to forecast traffic to avoid the regular traffic congestion situation in daily life. In today’s intelligent traffic system, reliable and precise traffic forecasting in metropolitan road networks is critical. Many models based on classical methods have been presented to address this; however, they lag in certain circumstances, failing to incorporate spatial and temporal dependency in the environment. As a result, this research aims to solve the geographical and temporal dependency problem that plagues most traffic forecasting models. Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are employed in conjunction with an attention-based model for more accurate traffic forecasts in cities. A combined model called Spatio-Temporal Attention-based Model with GCN and GRU (ST AGG) is employed to anticipate traffic. ST-AGG model mainly focuses on extracting the relevant information from all the input given to the attention-based model. The spatial dependency is determined by using GCN and the temporal dependency is determined by using GRU, used in the ST-AGG model. It assists in short-term traffic forecasting as well as long-term traffic forecasting. The results demonstrate that the suggested ST AGG has properly predicted the volume of traffic on city roadways in real time with greater accuracy. The model depicts how traffic is influenced by geography and time. The Shen Zhen (SZ) car dataset from China and the Los Angeles (LAS) dataset from California are used to test the suggested model. And the result shows that Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) have reduced by up to 2.7% less, and accuracy has increased by 2.7% more compared to the previous model ST GCN for the SZ vehicle dataset. Similarly, although the accuracy has not changed significantly for the Loss Angeles data set, RMSE and MAE have reduced by 3.71% less as compared to the previous ST GCN model. The proposed model is more effective than the prior models like GCN, GRU, and ST GCN. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Real-time traffic in a cellular network varies over time and often shows tidal patterns, such as the day/night traffic pattern. With this characteristic, we can reduce the energy consumption of a cellular network by consolidating workloads spreading over the entire network to fewer Base Stations (BSs). In this work, we propose a BS sleeping strategy for a two-tier Heterogeneous Cellular Network (HeCN) that consists of Macro Base Stations (MaBS) and Micro Base Stations (MiBS). We first use a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural network to predict the future traffic of each user. Based on the predicted traffic, our proposed BS sleeping strategy switches user connections from underutilized MiBSs to other BSs, then switches off the idle MiBSs. The MaBSs are never switched off. All user connections have predefined Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio thresholds, and we ensure that each user's service quality, which is related to the user's traffic demand rate, is not degraded when switching user connections. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed strategy over four other baselines through extensive numerical simulations, where our proposed strategy substantially outperforms the four baselines in different scenarios.  © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Reliable traffic forecasts are critical for successful planning and financing of transportation projects. However, the accuracy evaluation results of the predicted traffic volumes often indicate significant discrepancies between the actual and predicted traffic volumes. These discrepancies are mainly due to both limitations and uncertainties in traffic demand forecasting models; therefore, researchers are continuously attempting to estimate the error and bias in traffic forecasts. To enhance these endeavors, a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)-based approach is proposed in this paper as an alternative to the stochastic traffic demand forecast. This approach uses a sequential process to capture the effects of model inputs and variables on the error and bias in traffic demand forecasting. The approach proposed in this study was developed in three steps. First, the key factors causing errors and biases in traffic demand forecasts were identified based on a comprehensive review of traffic forecasting practices. Second, the effects of each variable on traffic volumes were quantified using MCS. Lastly, the statistical approach was constructed to provide an interval estimation of traffic volumes based on the findings of MCS. Through these steps, the inherent uncertainties in socioeconomic variables and heterogeneities in passenger behaviors with regard to traffic demand modeling were considered. Then, simulation experiments were conducted to investigate the applicability of the proposed approach to a real-world network. This approach is expected to reasonably capture the stochastic nature of future traffic volumes and quantify the risks associated with the error and bias in traffic demand forecasting. The findings of this study indicate that traffic forecasting practitioners can use the proposed approach with ease. The analysis results showed that the proposed approach clearly captured the changes in link traffic volumes owing to the statistical changes in the value of time (VOT). The experiments indicated that the uncertainties in VOT perceived by road users can be used to estimate the risks of toll road financing. The elasticity of traffic volume to VOT for each link, which can be used as a key input to the road project feasibility study, can be derived from the MCS-based analysis implemented in this study. © 2024, Strojarski Facultet.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is the key to transportation safety and efficiency. The advance in machine learning and deep learning has promoted the development of intelligent transportation systems. For example, the emergence of Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) has benefitted researchers a lot in dealing with large scale dataset and complex deep learning algorithms. In traffic forecasting, despite the success of deep learning-based models, there are still shortcomings, such as inadequate use of temporal and spatial traffic information, and indirect modeling of dependencies in traffic data. To address these challenges, we learn the transportation network in the form of a graph, and use graph wavelet as a key component to extract well-positioned features from the graph based on the transportation network. Compared with graph convolution, graph wavelets are very flexible and do not need to specify adjacent regions in the topological graph structure for feature extraction. At the same time, we propose to combine the multi-information fusion traffic control and guidance collaborative neural network and the results obtained are better than the benchmark algorithms. The results by comparison with several baseline methods show that our proposed method can outperform all the baseline methods.  © 1968-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Human mobility prediction is crucial for epidemic control, urban planning, and traffic forecasting systems. We observe urban traffic flow prediction has a hierarchical structure, in which humanmobility prediction should consider not only the spatial and the temporal relationships, but also the high-level mobility trend between individuals and regions. In this paper, we propose a human mobility clustering algorithm based on trend iteration of spectral clustering (TISC) to incorporate the high-level human mobility trend between individuals and regions. We integrate our TISC clustering algorithm with two existing urban traffic flow predictive models: namely, deep spatio-temporal residual network (ST-ResNet) and deep spatio-temporal 3D network (ST-3DNet). By adapting our TISC clustering algorithm, the prediction accuracy of both algorithms has been improved significantly (30.96% for ST-ResNet and 24.66%for ST-3DNet).We also compare the TISCbased predictive framework with 26 state-of-the-art human mobility prediction algorithms. We observe that our TISC algorithm considerably outperforms all 26 methods, reducing the predictive error from 6.93% to 69.55%.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of China’s aviation industry, the accurate prediction of civil aviation passenger volume is crucial to the sustainable development of the industry. However, the current prediction of civil aviation passenger traffic has not yet reached the ideal accuracy, so it is particularly important to improve the accuracy of prediction. This paper explores and compares the effectiveness of the backpropagation (BP) neural network model and the SARIMA model in predicting civil aviation passenger traffic. Firstly, this study utilizes data from 2006 to 2019, applies these two models separately to forecast civil aviation passenger traffic in 2019, and combines the two models to forecast the same period. Through comparing the mean relative error (MRE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE), the prediction accuracies of the two single models and the combined model are evaluated, and the best prediction method is determined. Subsequently, using the data from 2006 to 2019, the optimal method is applied to forecast the civil aviation passenger traffic from 2020 to 2023. Finally, this paper compares the epidemic’s impact on civil aviation passenger traffic with the actual data. This paper improves the prediction accuracy of civil aviation passenger volume, and the research results have practical significance for understanding and evaluating the impact of the epidemic on the aviation industry. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, increasingly more data are being acquired by intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), which is of great significance for traffic flow forecasting. Efficient intelligent traffic management systems (TMSs) depend on accurately forecasting traffic flows as well as reasonably researching and judging traffic states. However, the current prediction models used in transportation forecasting tasks are traditional temporal- and spatial-dimensional prediction approaches. Especially when faced with road channelization, the numbers of lanes and lane types increase significantly, causing significant increases in the dimensionality and complexity of traffic data, and research models utilizing the cross-interaction relationships among multiple dimensions have not been considered. This has led to unsatisfactory prediction results in complex traffic environments. Therefore, it is very important to explore the exchange–correlation of complex dimensional data and the mining of hidden attributes. This paper presents a method for performing multidimensional cross-attention and spatiotemporal graph convolution. This method fully considers cross-information and constructs an attention cross-view between every pair of dimensions among the channel, time and space domains to model the cross-dimensional dependencies of traffic data. We innovatively propose a triple cross-attention and graph convolutional network (TC-GCN), which can achieve further improved traffic forecasting performance. The TC-GCN is verified on two real-world traffic datasets, namely, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, and the experimental results are compared with those of multiple advanced baselines, showing that the proposed approach outperforms most of these baselines, which proves the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation system management and control. Due to the highly complex spatiotemporal (ST) correlation of real-world road networks, dynamic and long-term traffic prediction presents many challenges. We propose a traffic speed prediction model based on dynamic structural prior (DSP) ST graph attention networks. We provide a structural prior graph, namely, dual graph convolution, which combines spatial and contextual subgraphs to enable the discovery of the non-Euclidean spatial correlation and potential contextual similarity of road networks. Moreover, to dynamically extract the ST correlation, this article employs a multihead self-attention temporal convolution module to capture the temporal correlation and a graph attention convolution module to extract the spatial correlation. The prediction output is generated by stacking multiple ST blocks. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that DSP-ST outperforms existing mainstream baselines, which can provide references for traffic management departments.  © 2009-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Various external factors that interfere with traffic flow, such as weather conditions, traffic accidents, incidents, and Points of Interest (POIs), need to be considered in performing traffic forecasting tasks. However, the current research methods encounter difficulties in effectively incorporating these factors with traffic characteristics and efficiently updating them, which leads to a lack of dynamics and interpretability. Moreover, capturing temporal dependence and spatial dependence separately and sequentially can result in issues, such as information loss and model errors. To address these challenges, we present a Knowledge Representation learning-actuated spatial–temporal graph neural network (KR-STGNN) for traffic flow prediction. We combine the knowledge embedding with the traffic features via Gated Feature Fusion Module (GFFM), and dynamically update the traffic features adaptively according to the importance of external factors. To conduct the co-capture of spatial–temporal dependencies, we subsequently propose a spatial–temporal feature synchronous capture module (ST-FSCM) combining dilation causal convolution with GRU. Experimental results on a real-world traffic data set demonstrate that KR-STGNN has superior forecasting performances over diverse prediction horizons, especially for short-term prediction. The ablation and perturbation analysis experiments further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the designed method. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Spatiotemporal forecasting of traffic flow data represents a typical problem for urban traffic management, involving complex interactions, nonlinearities, and long-range dependencies due to the interwoven nature of the temporal and spatial dimensions. Traditional statistical and machine learning methods struggle to handle both temporal and spatial dependencies in such datasets. While graph convolutional networks and multi-head attention mechanisms have been widely adopted in this field, they often fail to accurately model dynamic temporal patterns and effectively differentiate noise from signals in traffic datasets, leading to potential overfitting. This paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a wavelet dynamic spatiotemporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN), for tackling the traffic forecasting problem. A key feature of W-DSTAGNN is the use of wavelets that can effectively separate noise and capture multi-resolution temporal patterns. Wavelet decomposition can help by decomposing the signal into components that can be analyzed independently, reducing the impact of non-stationarity and handling long-range dependencies of traffic flow datasets. These enable our proposal to generate more robust and accurate forecasts of complex and dynamic traffic dependencies than commonly used spatiotemporal deep learning models. Benchmark experiments using three popularly used statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations and outperforms eleven state-of-the-art models (including both temporal and spatiotemporal benchmarks) on three publicly available traffic datasets. Our proposed approach can better handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies, delivering reliable long-term forecasts, and generating interval forecasts to enhance probabilistic forecasting of traffic datasets. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Abstract: A smooth traffic flow is very crucial for an intelligent traffic system. Consequently, traffic forecasting is critical in achieving unwrinkled traffic flow. However, due to its spatial and temporal interdependence, traffic forecasting might be more difficult. Graph neural networks (GNN) are widely used to obtain traffic forecasting due to their capability to operate in non-Euclidean data. The topological connection of the traffic network plays a crucial role in graph structure learning. Therefore, the importance of the adjacency matrix in graph construction might be significant for effective traffic forecasting. As a result, for efficient graph construction, a Deep Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DSTGNN) is proposed for the construction of the weighted adjacency matrix and traffic speed prediction accurately by recording topological and temporal information. Three different weighted adjacency matrices are suggested depending on three different proposed algorithms for different variations of traffic’s spatial condition. The new adjacency matrix is used in a novel DSTGNN for predicting the traffic state. The novel model comprised multiple layers with skip connections to adequately extract the variation of temporal and spatial information. DSTGNN outperforms the standard and other graph neural network models on four traffic speed datasets, SZ-taxi, Los-loop, PeMSD7, and METR-LA.

AB  - 5G networks are expected to support various services and applications with more stringent latency, reliability, and bandwidth requirements than previous generations. Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) have been proposed to meet these requirements. The O-RAN Alliance assumes O-RAN components to be Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs). Furthermore, O-RAN allows employing Machine Learning (ML) solutions to tackle challenges in resource management. However, intelligently managing resources for O-RAN can be proved challenging. Network providers need to scale resources in response to incoming traffic dynamically. Elastically allocating resources provides higher flexibility, reduces OPerational EXpenditure (OPEX), and increases resource utilization. In this work, we propose and evaluate an elastic VNF orchestration framework for O-RAN. The proposed system consists of a traffic forecasting-based dynamic scaling scheme using ML and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based VNF placement policy. The models are evaluated based on their predictive capabilities subject to all Service-Level Agreements.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Due to the growing level of transportation systems, numerous social troubles arise and create serious hazards like air pollution, the greenhouse effect, and traffic congestion. Hence, Traffic forecasting is essential for providing numerous applications in smart city management like congestion avoidance, navigation guidance, and urban traffic control. Still, the traffic prediction is difficult, since each road network is greatly dependent on other networks in a temporally and spatially manner. For capturing the temporal and spatial dependency, the Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX) - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Forward Taylor Network (NxLFTN)based traffic forecasting is proposed in this paper. The traffic network is considered as a graph, which contains the spatio-temporal data. The spatio-temporal data is high-dimensional and complex. To embed the data into a low-dimensionality region, the spatio-temporal embedding (STE) generator is employed. Moreover, the STE generator is used for predicting the daily embedding and the weekly embedding of the time related to the present traffic signal. At last, the traffic forecasting is carried out using the NxLFTNet. In addition, the Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Root Mean square error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to validate the effectiveness of the NxLFTNet. It offered the finest MAPE, RMSE, and MAE of 0.003, 0.046, and 0.04 when considering the data from the Contra Costa country in Greater Bay Area (GBA) of LargeST dataset for delay is 50 minutes. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

AB  - When offering services such as e-commerce on the cloud, there is a necessity to adjust the amount of server resources provided in response to the irregularly increasing and decreasing traffic. This need arises when there is a desire to maintain a constant level of service while, at the same time, minimizing costs as much as possible. There is an abundance of prior research regarding the prediction of future loads from past time-series data. Many of these approaches rely on traditional time-series forecasting, which necessitates that the data used for learning adhere to stationary or unit root processes, or they use deep learning approaches that include using a vast amount of data and parameters. In this study, we propose a traffic forecasting method that includes dynamic window size changes that can follow even slight variation in trends. This method incorporates a fuzzy-entropy-based burst traffic detection in the regression estimation with sliding-window learning. In the evaluation, we conduct four comparative experiments using actual traffic rather than simulations. As a result, compared to the baseline, the proposed reduced the number of request failures and improved the Mean Squared Error between the ideal and the actual container count by 26.4 points on average. © 2024 Information Processing Society of Japan.

AB  - Metro passenger flow prediction is a crucial and challenging task in the intelligent transportation system of subways. It serves as the foundation for achieving intelligent transportation in subway systems and holds significant importance in practical applications. Although much progress has been made, accurate traffic flow prediction still faces challenges. To address this, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (STFGCN) for predicting metro passenger flow. Specifically, we employ Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to replace the Fourier Transform used in traditional models, which avoids the Gibbs phenomenon associated with the Fourier Transform. We combine DCT with channel attention to form periodic trend-enhancing attention, thereby enhancing the expressive power of the model. Furthermore, we introduce trend similarity-aware attention to capture the evolutionary trends of time series and adopt a dynamic correlation graph convolutional network to dynamically adjust spatial correlation strengths based on changes in different time periods. Experimental results on the Hangzhou Metro's inbound and outbound passenger flow datasets demonstrate that the STFGCN model exhibits significant superiority over baseline models and shows excellent performance in metro passenger flow prediction. Compared to the CorrSTN model, STFGCN achieves improvements of 22.15%, 16.9%, and 0.6% in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - To achieve accurate traffic forecasting, previous research has employed inner and outer aggregation for information aggregation, and attention mechanisms for heterogeneous spatiotemporal dependency learning, which results in inefficient model learning. While learning efficiency is critical due to the need for updating frequently the model to alleviate the impact of concept drift, limited work has focused on improving it. For efficient learning and accurate forecasting, this study proposes the dynamic spatiotemporal straight-flow network (DSTSFN). Breaking the aggregation paradigms employing both inner and outer aggregation, which may be redundant, the DSTSFN designs a straight-flow network that employs bipartite graphs to learn directly the dependencies between the source and target nodes for outer aggregation only. Instead of the attention mechanisms, the dynamic graphs/networks, which outdo static ones by possessing time-varying dependencies, are designed in the DSTSFN to distinguish the dependency heterogeneity, making the model relatively streamlined. Additionally, two learning strategies based on respectively the curriculum and transfer learning are developed to further improve the learning efficiency of the DSTSFN. Our study could be the first work designing the learning strategies for the multi-step traffic predictor based on dynamic spatiotemporal graphs. The learning efficiency and forecasting accuracy are demonstrated by experiments, which show that the DSTSFN can outperform not only the state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictor for accuracy by achieving a 2.27% improvement in accuracy and requiring only 8.98% of the average training time, but also the SOTA predictor for efficiency by achieving a 9.26% improvement in accuracy and requiring 91.68% of the average training time.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This paper implements a two-staged ensemble learning model for traffic forecasting, focusing on the interpretability of predictions. The stacking model leverages the advantages of its diverse component learning models. Experiments on high-dimensional and sparse data validate the stacking model's superior predictive accuracy compared to baseline models, including LightGBM and XGBoost. In addition to validating the stacking model's outstanding predictive performance, this paper emphasizes the interpretability of its predictions by proposing an innovative explanation model based on feature contributions. This explanation model addresses the high dimension and sparsity in data prevalent in transportation engineering with its integration of resampling and consensus clustering, offering a scalable, stable, and computationally efficient solution ideal for real-Time and large-scale applications. The paper presents theoretical justification, experimental results, and empirical validation of the interpretation model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's enhanced stability compared to traditional shapley additive explanations (SHAP) implementations such as kernel SHAP. Investigating trade-offs between stability and computational efficiency of resampling provides insights for optimal configuration choices. This paper contributes to traffic flow prediction with broad applicability in real-Time and large-scale traffic management scenarios, underscoring the vital role of ensemble learning and interpretable machine learning in contemporary data-driven decision making processes. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is a critical component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, the dynamic temporal variations in traffic flow, especially in potential occurrence of unexpected incidents, pose challenges to the prediction of traffic flow. This paper proposes a Spatial–temporal Gated Attention Transformer (STGAFormer) model based Graph Neural Network(GNN), leveraging the encoder architecture of the transformer. The gated temporal self-attention in the model, a novel module, can improve the model's ability to make long-term predictions and handle sudden traffic incidents by enhancing the extraction of both local and global temporal features. Additionally, this paper proposes a distance spatial self-attention module to extract spatial features, which employs thresholding to selectively identify crucial features from both nearby and distant regions. In this way, the model's ability to assimilate critical spatial information is promoted. Moreover, our model incorporates a diverse range of inputs, including traffic flow attributes, periodicity, proximity adjacency matrix, and adaptive adjacency matrix. Experiments from four real datasets demonstrate that STGAFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially the MAE value of the PeMS08 dataset experiment is improved by 3.82%. This method offers valuable insights and robust support for future transportation planning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Big city traffic is getting more and more backed up and wasting precious resources like time and fuel resulting into a great loss on GDP. Hence traffic congestion must be resolved immediately. In an intelligent transportation system, a lot of data from many different categories can be gathered and evaluated in order to predict and prevent traffic flow and road congestion. Dealing with this massive data is important but it is difficult. While most of the literature uses batch processing to handle large amounts of road data, real-time traffic prediction is not possible. In this research work, analyze huge streaming data, such as rainfall volume, traffic events, and road density, and employ Storm plus's spouts and bolts to create a real-time traffic forecast model. This paper outlines Storm plus's architecture as well as its distributed scale-out and fault-tolerance techniques. The real-time data set derived from storm plus was curated with RFE for eliminating irrelevant features. The execution of Storm Plus queries for traffic prediction is also covered in this paper. The proposed real-time urban traffic congestion prediction model was evaluated with SP-SVM and SP-CNN gathers. In our implementation SP-CNN has outperformed SP-SVM in the prediction accuracy. Finally Time series analysis helped us to regulate traffic flow from going out of hand as congestion. © 2024, Collegium Basilea. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is essential in urban traffic management, route planning, and flow detection. Recent advances in spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives and have neglected the interactive learning between spatial and temporal correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies fail to consider distinct spatial-temporal patterns of each node. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Interactive Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (STIDGCN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose an interactive learning framework composed of spatial and temporal modules for downsampling traffic data. This framework aims to capture spatial and temporal correlations by adopting a perception perspective from the global to the local level and facilitating their mutual utilization with positive feedback. In the spatial module, we design a dynamic graph convolutional network based on graph construction methods. The network is designed to leverage a traffic pattern bank considering spatial-temporal heterogeneity as a query to reconstruct a data-driven dynamic graph structure. The reconstructed graph structure can reveal dynamic associations between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on eight real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STIDGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

AB  - Mega-constellation network traffic forecasting provides key information for routing and resource allocation, which is of great significance to the performance of satellite networks. However, due to the self-similarity and long-range dependence (LRD) of mega-constellation network traffic, traditional linear/non-linear forecasting models cannot achieve sufficient forecasting accuracy. In order to resolve this problem, a mega-constellation network traffic forecasting model based on EMD (empirical mode decomposition)-ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) and IGWO (improved grey wolf optimizer) optimized BPNN (back-propagation neural network) is proposed in this paper, which makes comprehensive utilization of linear model ARIMA, non-linear model BPNN and optimization algorithm IGWO. With the enhancement of the global optimization capability of a BPNN, the proposed hybrid model can fully realize the potential of mining linear and non-linear laws of mega-constellation network traffic, hence improving the forecasting accuracy. This paper utilizes an ON/OFF model to generate historical self-similar traffic to forecast. RMSE (root mean square error), MAE (mean absolute error), R-square and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) are adopted as evaluation indexes for the forecasting effect. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional constellation network traffic forecasting schemes, with several improvements in forecasting accuracy and efficiency. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate forecasting of traffic conditions is critical for improving urban transportation safety, stability, and efficiency. It is challenging to produce explicit traffic forecasts due to complex and dynamic spatiotemporal contexts. Most existing works only capture partial characteristics and features of traffic data, and there still exists a great potential of uplifting the forecasting performances. In this article, we propose a periodic feature-folding network (PFFN) that globally folds the spatial-temporal-geo-character features of collected data into pivotal levels to enhance the forecasting performance of traffic conditions. Meanwhile, the historical and recent traffic information within the subgraph is locally folded to capture similar traffic patterns and determine meaningful high-level features in latent space via a novel gated attention plug (GAP). During forecasting, the auxiliary road attributes are jointwise folded with locally engineered features to realize the multistep forecasting. Experimental results on two publicly accessible real-world urban traffic data sets show that the proposed PFFN can outperform the state-of-the-art benchmarks, significantly improving the performance of forecasting short-term traffic conditions.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The spatiotemporal learning has been one of the most burning research topics in traffic data analytics for traffic forecasting, which is instrumental in developing the intelligent transportation systems. Capturing accurately and efficiently complex spatiotemporal dependencies of the road network is a critical prerequisite of the traffic spatiotemporal forecasting. This study proposes a multi-view spatiotemporal learning (MVSTL) framework, which combines the fast parallel learning (FPL) and the serial learning (SL) to juggle the receptive field with the fitting capability of the model. The FPL is proposed to capture the spatiotemporal correlations synchronously and efficiently by reducing the number of parameters significantly. As a supplement to the FPL, the SL, which extracts the spatial and temporal features serially, can expand the spatial/temporal receptive fields and avoid information overwriting. The evaluation of the MVSTL is carried out by employing four sets of traffic data from the LA freeway system, and the experiment results reveal that the MVSTL is able to perform better than the advanced methods in prediction accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Due to the exponential rise in the number of vehicles and road segments in cities, traffic prediction becomes more difficult, necessitating the application of sophisticated algorithms such as deep learning (DL). The models used in the literature provide accurate predictions for specific cases when the data flow is properly prepared. However, in complex situations, these approaches fail, and thus, the prediction must be developed through a process rather than a prediction calculation method. In addition to using a pure and robust DL prediction model, an efficient approach could be built by taking into account two other factors, namely the relationships between road segments and the amount and quality of the training data. The main goal of our research is to develop a three-stage framework for road traffic prediction based on statistical and deep learning modules. First, a cross-correlation prediction with a Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM) is implemented to predict the influential road segments; second, a deep generative model (DGM)-based data augmentation is used to improve the data of the related segments; and third, we adapt a Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for interpretable Time Series (N-BEATS) architecture, to the resulting data to implement the prediction module. The framework components are trained and validated using the 6th Beijing road traffic dataset. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - A cyber-communication infrastructure is required for physical components like control systems, sensors, actuators, and the environment to communicate and collaborate in real-time effectively. This is what cyber-physical systems (CPSs) provide. Deep Learning (DL) techniques have sped up and improved the progress of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in recent years, especially in problem domains traditionally addressed with analytical or statistical solutions. In addition to advancing driverless vehicle development to a new level, the improvements brought about by DL applications have led to better traffic organization and scheduling, increased security and safety on transit roads, reduced maintenance costs, and optimized performance for public transportation ride-sharing companies. The primary goal of this work is to offer a complete study and awareness of the uses of DL models on ITS, as well as to demonstrate the development in ITS research that has been owing to DL studies. This article briefly introduces the reader to various DL methods before thoroughly examining and describing how these methods are now being used in the transportation sector. Deep learning models are trained on this real-world traffic information to detect better and forecast the probability of crashes. This work aims to do just that by providing a multi-perspective assessment of deep learning-based techniques for traffic forecasting. This paper offers a summary and taxonomy of current traffic forecast systems. We provide a compilation of the most cutting-edge methods currently used for traffic forecasting. In addition, we assess the efficacy of various approaches using a public, real-world dataset and provide an evaluation and analysis of our findings. These findings demonstrate that, related to state-of-the-art shallow models, a deep model is superior at traffic detection and achieves equivalent results in terms of traffic prediction. We suggest a new deep learning framework, an Attention-based hybrid Convolutional Neural network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (AHCNLS), to perform real-time traffic prediction from a data mining approach to enhance driver and passenger safety. The suggested approach considers the spatial and temporal connection between GPS trajectories and contextual elements. Using a publicly available dataset, our proposed technique is evaluated and shown to have advantages over competing methods. © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Vehicle-based traffic speed forecasting aims to predict the average speed of vehicles on the road in the future, which is an essential side information in intelligent vehicles and beneficial to safe autonomous driving, yet is very challenging due to the complex and dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies in real-world vehicle-based traffic. To extract intricate correlations among multiple vehicle-based speed time series, previous methods have used graph convolution networks. However, the conventional static and dynamic graphs fail to reflect the traffic evolution and the hysteresis spatial influence caused by vehicle movement. To address this issue, we propose a novel cross-time dynamic graph-based deep learning model, named CDGNet, for vehicle-based traffic speed forecasting. The model is able to effectively capture hysteresis spatial dependencies between each time slice and its historical time slices through the cross-time dynamic graph-based GCN. Meanwhile, a gating mechanism is integrated into our cross-time dynamic graph, which conforms to the sparse correlation in the real world. Besides, GCNs are incorporated into a novel encoder-decoder architecture to forecast multi-step speed. Experimental results on three real-world vehicle-based traffic speed datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CDGNet over various state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting methods and the effectiveness of each component. We additionally provide a visualization of our cross-time dynamic graph to show the capability of assisting intelligent vehicles to avoid congestion. IEEE

AB  - Many countries across the globe face the serious issue of traffic congestion. This paper presents a low-cost graph-based traffic forecasting and congestion detection framework using online images from multiple cameras. The advantage of using a graph neural network (GNN) for traffic forecasting and detection is that it represents the traffic network in a natural way. This framework requires only images from surveillance cameras without any other sensors. It converts the online images into two types of data: traffic volume and image-based traffic occupancy. A clustering-based graph construction method is proposed to build a graph based on the traffic network. For traffic forecasting, multiple models, including statistical models and deep graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs), are used and compared using the extracted data. The framework uses logistic regression to determine the threshold of traffic congestion. In the experiment, we found that the Decoupled Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (D2STGNN) model achieved the best performance on the collected dataset. We also propose a threshold-based method for detecting traffic congestion using traffic volume and image-based traffic occupancy. This framework provides a low-cost solution for traffic forecasting and congestion detection when only surveillance images are available.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Economic development has led to a continuous increase in people's demand for transportation, which has led to an imbalance between the supply and demand of road facilities. Traffic congestion, traffic safety and other issues have caused the road traffic environment to become increasingly poor, thereby hindering the development of cities. Therefore, in response to the inability of traditional traffic flow prediction techniques to handle constantly changing traffic flow data, a machine learning traffic flowing predicting model on the foundation of least squares support vector machine is proposed. A hybrid optimizing algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of least squares support vector machines in response to the sensitivity of model parameters. Three factors of genetic algorithm are introduced into particle swarm optimization to optimize this model. These experiments confirm that the fitting accuracy between model's predicted values and the actual values is over 90%, and the residual fluctuation is relatively small. Its RMSE is approximately 33.52% to 75.76% lower than the other three algorithms, its MAE is approximately 27% to 67% lower than other algorithms, and its EC is approximately 1% to 5% higher than other algorithms. The proposed hybrid optimization algorithm can find a set ofoptimal parameters, making the least squares support vector machine have good stability and prediction accuracy in predicting traffic flow problems. This model can be used to predict traffic flow, congestion conditions and other traffic indicators, providing a reliable theoretical basis for urban traffic management. © 2024, Aracne Editrice.

AB  - The complex spatial-temporal correlations in transportation networks make the traffic forecasting problem challenging. Since transportation system inherently possesses graph structures, many research efforts have been put with graph neural networks. Recently, constructing adaptive graphs to the data has shown promising results over the models relying on a single static graph structure. However, the graph adaptations are applied during the training phases and do not reflect the data used during the testing phases. Such shortcomings can be problematic especially in traffic forecasting since the traffic data often suffer from unexpected changes and irregularities in the time series. In this study, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework called Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN). PGCN constructs a set of graphs by progressively adapting to online input data during the training and testing phases. Specifically, we implemented the model to construct progressive adjacency matrices by learning trend similarities among graph nodes. Then, the model is combined with the dilated causal convolution and gated activation unit to extract temporal features. With residual and skip connections, PGCN performs the traffic prediction. When applied to seven real-world traffic datasets of diverse geometric nature, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance with consistency in all datasets. We conclude that the ability of PGCN to progressively adapt to input data enables the model to generalize in different study sites with robustness.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. Currently, most models need to pay more attention to the delay (history) state to improve forecasting performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic delay differential equation spatiotemporal network for traffic flow forecasting, named D3STN. First, our method integrates dynamic delay state optimization into delay differential equations to enhance delay state inputs and model forecasting performance. In addition, we propose a hybrid graph neural network and convolution multi-head attention mechanism. With the hybrid graph neural network, our method takes the multi-granularity correlation relationship into account to capture spatial characteristics from relevant nodes. With the convolution multi-head attention mechanism, our method balances the attention distribution between short-term and long-term attention. Empirical experiments are executed on highway traffic flow and metro flow datasets to evaluate the performance of our method. The results demonstrate that D3STN achieves significant advancements in traffic flow forecasting tasks. Compared with CorrSTN (baseline), D3STN makes improvements of 10.93%, 16.24% and 24.56% in terms of the MAE, RMSE and MAPE, respectively, on the HZME (outflow) dataset.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Although software-defined networking (SDN) promotes a centralized control plane for better resource management, it suffers from reliability and scalability issues. Consequently, the distributed SDN architecture proposes logically centralized but physically distributed controllers. Each controller manages a subset of the switches in the distributed SDN architecture. However, in real networks, the traffic condition is highly dynamic, which may lead to load imbalance among the controllers if the switch-controller association is static. Within this context, our study advances a novel approach of dynamically configuring switch-to-controller associations to rectify load disparities among controllers. This dynamic association is predicated upon applying short-term traffic forecasts, serving as a predictive tool for anticipating the forthcoming controller load. Our research undertakes a comprehensive examination to ascertain the ideal load parameters for each controller. Subsequently, a proactive load-balancing strategy is established, whereby switches are judiciously reassigned based on load predictions. This predictive load-balancing methodology not only rectifies load imbalances but also reduces the frequency of switch reassignments, thereby mitigating undue network disruptions. Empirical results from our proposed approach reveal a remarkable 90% reduction in switch reassignments compared to a traditional greedy approach. Furthermore, extensive experimentation and comparative performance analyses are undertaken to substantiate the efficacy of our proposed framework rigorously. These analyses collectively underscore the salient advantages of our approach, manifesting in superior network stability, comparable load divergence, and migration cost, when contrasted with the conventional greedy approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a challenging research topic due to the complex spatial and temporal dependencies among different roads. Though great efforts have been made on traffic forecasting, existing works still have the following shortcomings: i) Most methods only directly perform on the original road network topology which cannot accommodate the diverse traffic patterns and multi-granularity traffic forecasting requirements driven by the natural multi-level urban structure and layout, ii) The existing studies based on the spatio-temporal multi-granularity perspective ignore the interactions between the fine-grained information and coarse-grained information, resulting in the spatio-temporal correlation under multi-granularity inaccurately modeled. To solve the problems, we propose an Adaptive and Interactive Multi-level Spatio-Temporal network (AIMST) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we first devise a learnable adaptive hierarchical clustering method to automatically generate more coarse-grained graphs from the initial road networks and the traffic data. Then, the spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks are executed on the constructed hierarchical traffic graph of each level correspondingly to capture the spatio-temporal patterns. Furthermore, a multi-level bidirectional interaction module is designed to emphasize the multi-grained interaction patterns among different levels. Extensive experiments on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our framework is superior to several state-of-the-art baselines.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Controlling and coordinating urban traffic flow through robot vehicles (RVs) is emerging as a novel transportation paradigm for the future. While this approach garners growing attention from researchers and practitioners, effectively managing and coordinating large-scale mixed traffic remains a challenge. We introduce an effective framework for large-scale mixed traffic control via privacy-preserving crowdsourcing and dynamic vehicle routing. Our framework consists of three modules: 1) a privacy-protecting crowdsensing method; 2) a graph propagation-based traffic forecasting method; and 3) a privacy-preserving route selection mechanism. We evaluate our framework using a real-world road network. The results show that our framework accurately forecasts traffic flow, efficiently mitigates network-wide RV shortage issue, and coordinates large-scale mixed traffic. Compared to other baseline methods, our framework not only reduces the RV shortage issue up to 69.4% but also reduces the average waiting time of all vehicles in the network up to 27%.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on transportation across the United States. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the pandemic’s impact on vehicular traffic at the later stage of the pandemic. Therefore, this paper studies the change of freeway traffic patterns in two metropolitan counties in the State of Utah at the latter stage of the pandemic. We found that with the relaxation of travel restriction and the COVID vaccine, vehicular traffic has recovered to equaling, if not exceeding, pre-pandemic levels. Truck traffic is higher than the pre-pandemic level due to the growth of online shopping and on-demand delivery. To help responsive agencies to prepare for the near-future traffic pattern, a traffic prediction model based on an innovative approach integrating machine learning with graph theory is proposed. The evaluation shows that the proposed prediction model has a desirable performance. The mean absolute percentage prediction error is between 0.38% and 1.74% for different jurisdictions. On average, the modal outperforms the traditional long short-term memory model by 31.20% in terms of root mean squared prediction error. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is of paramount importance in the field of spatio-temporal forecasting. In recent years, research efforts have primarily been directed towards developing intricate graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture spatial complexities. However, this has inadvertently led to the neglect of the inherent temporal correlations in traffic prediction, as well as the heterogeneity of graph structures. As a result, existing models show limited efficacy when dealing with the complex nature of traffic data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel traffic prediction model: the Fourier-enhanced heterogeneous graph convolution attention recurrent network (FEHGCARN). This model integrates historical information and incorporates a graph convolution attention recurrent unit (GCARU), meticulously engineered to effectively capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, it features a Fourier-enhanced heterogeneous graph learning module, which facilitates the acquisition of complex relationships among nodes in the frequency domain. Notably, this memory network excels at recognizing abrupt traffic conditions. To validate our approach, we conducted comprehensive comparisons using three authentic datasets and benchmarked our model against six state-of-the-art baseline methods. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the superior performance of our model across all evaluation metrics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper illustrates a general framework in which a neural network application can be easily integrated and proposes a traffic forecasting approach that uses neural networks based on graphs. Neural networks based on graphs have the advantage of capturing spatial–temporal characteristics that cannot be captured by other types of neural networks. This is due to entries that are graphs that, by their nature, include, besides a certain topology (the spatial characteristic), connections between nodes that model the costs (traffic load, speed, and road length) of the roads between nodes that can vary over time (the temporal characteristic). As a result, a prediction in a node influences the prediction from adjacent nodes, and, globally, the prediction has more precision. On the other hand, an adequate neural network leads to a good prediction, but its complexity can be higher. A recurrent neural network like LSTM is suitable for making predictions. A reduction in complexity can be achieved by choosing a relatively small number (usually determined by experiments) of hidden levels. The use of graphs as inputs to the neural network and the choice of a recurrent neural network combined lead to good accuracy in traffic prediction with a low enough implementation effort that it can be accomplished on microcontrollers with relatively limited resources. The proposed method minimizes the communication network (between vehicles and database servers) load and represents a reasonable trade-off between the communication network load and forecasting accuracy. Traffic prediction leads to less-congested routes and, therefore, to a reduction in energy consumption. The traffic is forecasted using an LSTM neural network with a regression layer. The inputs of the neural network are sequences—obtained from a graph that represents the road network—at specific moments in time that are read from traffic sensors or the outputs of the neural network (forecasting sequences). The input sequences can be filtered to improve the forecasting accuracy. This general framework is based on the Contiki IoT operating system, which ensures support for wireless communication and the efficient implementation of processes in a resource-constrained system, and it is particularized to implement a graph neural network. Two cases are studied: one case in which the traffic sensors are periodically read and another case in which the traffic sensors are read when their values’ changes are detected. A comparison between the cases is made, and the influence of filtering is evaluated. The obtained accuracy is very good and is very close to the accuracy obtained in an infinite precision simulation, the computation time is low enough, and the system can work in real time. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - As networks expand to support various applications involving text, audio, video, and images, data traffic increases correspondingly. Traffic classification, which identifies the origin of observed traffic, has multiple applications, including dynamic bandwidth allocation, traffic analysis, quality of service, and network security. Traditional network traffic classification methods like deep packet inspection rely on manually creating and maintaining communication profiles for various applications. However, these methods face challenges such as dynamic port changes and encrypted traffic. Machine Learning (ML) classifiers offer effective solutions to these issues, providing accurate network traffic classification. Due to these advancements, deep learning models are now utilized for network traffic classification and prediction. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has emerged as a highly effective deep learning technique for addressing time series prediction challenges. This study aims to analyze the performance of forecasting network traffic using LSTM, with different activation functions and optimizers with Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R-Squared) parameters as the model evaluation index. This demonstrates how these parameters impact network traffic forecasting performance. © 2024, Publishing House of the Romanian Academy. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, there has been rapid development in autonomous vehicle techniques due to the increasing demands in traffic management and travel planning. Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is crucial for autonomous vehicles. However, most existing methods are task-specific and tailored for specific cities, making them hard to apply for more downstream applications. These methods fail to accurately simulate the common variation of traffic states at different locations based on their spatial distance and time interval. Compared with most existing spatiotemporal prediction baselines, this paper proposes a joint pre-training framework, named JointSTNet, to further enhance the traffic spatiotemporal prediction accuracy while reducing model complexity for traffic forecasting tasks. Firstly, unlike treating traffic spatiotemporal data on roads as independent patterns, the spatial graph capsule module constructs inter-class traffic patterns based on shared dynamics within the dynamic graph structure. Additionally, the temporal encoding gated module proposed in our work expands the temporal receptive field along the time axis. Finally, we maximize reconstruction losses to handle incomplete connections within data involving intra-cluster and inter-cluster regional semantic relationships that can be enhanced through pre-training. Experimental results on four benchmarking datasets from the real world demonstrate that JointSTNet outperforms various types of state-of-the-art baselines.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - The macroscopic continuum traffic flow models are being investigated to predict and ameliorate traffic more efficiently. These models are beneficial implementation tools to comprehend and complement the shortfalls in traffic evolution. Despite the significant enhancements in devising the traffic dynamics, the practical utilization of these macroscopic models is not being fully explored. In this study, the Non-Homogeneous Stimulus-Response Model (NHSRM) (Imran et al., 2023) is investigated for its application in forecasting traffic flow on a curvy highway during various weather conditions. The weather impact, in the specific, dry, light rainfall, moderate rainfall, and heavy rainfall on the travel time, velocity, and density spatiotemporal evolution on a curvy highway is analyzed. The flow during different weather conditions is investigated over two curved roads with 120 m, and 500 m radii. As evident from the results, significant velocity breakdowns during heavy rainfall impact the upstream traffic which contributes to congestion development. The average velocity of traffic depletes significantly, and the congestion formation upstream is significant. While the travel time of particular highway segments elevates sharply during heavy rainfall. A comprehensive understanding of the insights, and the critically associated with the parameters of the model, in particular, on the choice of the maximum velocity of the highway has been presented for NHSRM. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Hourly traffic volume prediction is now emerging to mitigate and respond to hourly-level traffic congestion augmented by deep learning techniques. Incorporating meteorological data into the forecasting of hourly traffic volumes substantively improves the precision of long-term traffic forecasts. Nonetheless, integrating weather data into traffic prediction models is challenging due to the complex interplay between traffic flow, time-based patterns, and meteorological conditions. This paper proposes a graph convolutional network to predict long-term traffic volume with meteorological information. This study utilized a four-year traffic volume and meteorological information dataset in Chung-ju si to train and validate the models. The proposed model performed better than the other baseline scenarios with conventional and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Furthermore, the counterfactual scenarios analysis revealed the potential negative impacts of meteorological conditions on traffic volume. These findings will enable transportation planners predict hourly traffic volumes for different scenarios, such as harsh weather conditions or holidays. Furthermore, predicting the microscopic traffic simulation for different scenarios of weather conditions or holidays is useful. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: An important and challenging question for air transportation regulators and airport operators is the definition and specification of airport capacity. Annual capacity is used for long-term planning purposes as a degree of available service volume, but it poses several inefficiencies when measuring the true throughput of the system because of seasonal and daily variations of traffic. Instead, airport throughput is calculated or estimated for a short period of time, usually one hour. This brings about a mismatch: air traffic forecasts typically yield annual volumes, whereas capacity is measured on hourly figures. To manage the right balance between airport capacity and demand, annual traffic volumes must be converted into design hour volumes, so that they can be compared with the true throughput of the system. This comparison is a cornerstone in planning new airport infrastructures, as design-period parameters are important for airport planners in anticipating where and when congestion occurs. Although the design hour for airport traffic has historically had a number of definitions, it is necessary to improve the way air traffic design hours are selected. This study aims to provide an empirical analysis of airport capacity and demand, specifically focusing on insights related to air traffic design hours and the relationship between capacity and delay. Design/methodology/approach: By reviewing the empirical relationships between hourly and annual air traffic volumes and between practical capacity and delay at 50 European airports during the period 2004–2021, this paper discusses the problem of defining a suitable peak hour for capacity evaluation purposes. The authors use information from several data sources, including EUROCONTROL, ACI and OAG. This study provides functional links between design hours and annual volumes for different airport clusters. Additionally, the authors appraise different daily traffic distribution patterns and their variation by hour of the day. Findings: The clustering of airports with respect to their capacity, operational and traffic characteristics allows us to discover functional relationships between annual traffic and the percentage of traffic in the design hour. These relationships help the authors to propose empirical methods to derive expected traffic in design hours from annual volumes. The main conclusion is that the percentage of total annual traffic that is concentrated at the design hour maintains a predictable behavior through a “potential” adjustment with respect to the volume of annual traffic. Moreover, the authors provide an experimental link between capacity and delay so that peak hour figures can be related to factors that describe the quality of traffic operations. Originality/value: The functional relationships between hourly and annual air traffic volumes and between capacity and delay, can be used to properly assess airport expansion projects or to optimize resource allocation tasks. This study offers new evidence on the nature of airport capacity and the dynamics of air traffic design hours and delay. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The rapid urbanization observed over recent decades has led to important challenges in urban mobility, notably traffic congestion, pollution, and inefficient energy consumption. Concurrently, the rise in electric vehicles (EVs) offers a promising shift towards sustainable urban transport yet introduces complexities such as the need for extensive charging infrastructure and effective energy demand management. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a predictive model for real-time and future traffic volume estimation, leveraging historical data, real-time information, scheduled city events, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure. The methodology proposed employs actuarial techniques to create a comprehensive framework that predicts traffic patterns and optimizes energy resources within smart cities. By integrating variables such as historical traffic patterns and real-time data, our model provides accurate traffic forecasts essential for urban planning and energy distribution. We utilize a time-series based algorithm to predict traffic, validated through real data from pilot projects in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The study’s findings underscore the model’s potential to enhance urban mobility and energy efficiency, providing a robust tool for city planners and policymakers. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Recent studies have shifted their focus towards formulating traffic forecasting as a spatio-temporal graph modeling problem. Typically, they constructed a static spatial graph at each time step and then connected each node with itself between adjacent time steps to create a spatio-temporal graph. However, this approach failed to explicitly reflect the correlations between different nodes at different time steps, thus limiting the learning capability of graph neural networks. Additionally, those models overlooked the dynamic spatio-temporal correlations among nodes by using the same adjacency matrix across different time steps. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called Spatio-Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Networks (STJGCN) for accurate traffic forecasting on road networks over multiple future time steps. Specifically, our method encompasses the construction of both pre-defined and adaptive spatio-temporal joint graphs (STJGs) between any two time steps, which represent comprehensive and dynamic spatio-temporal correlations. We further introduce dilated causal spatio-temporal joint graph convolution layers on the STJG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies from distinct perspectives with multiple ranges. To aggregate information from different ranges, we propose a multi-range attention mechanism. Finally, we evaluate our approach on five public traffic datasets and experimental results demonstrate that STJGCN is not only computationally efficient but also outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baseline methods.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted in numerous fields and enabled various smart systems because of its strong ability to perform tasks, including prediction, event detection, and status estimation, among others. As one of the typical smart systems empowered by AI and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the smart transportation system has made dramatic progress for traditional transportation in numerous aspects, including autonomous driving, smart traffic lights, navigation, and traffic forecasting, among others. Deep learning is an essential component to enable such smart systems. Typically, specific deep learning models, e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), can be trained on collected transportation data for a particular task. However, traditional deep learning techniques rely on data sufficiency to build an effective model. Additionally, each trained model can only work on one single task. This has limited the efficacy of deep learning techniques in numerous application scenarios. To this end, multi-task learning (MTL) has been studied to train a single model that can work for multiple tasks. This technique effectively allows the learning model to expand to specific tasks with only a limited amount of data affiliated. In the meantime, MTL significantly reduces the training time of each task. The success of MTL requires that there are potential relationships among different tasks. Many tasks in the smart transportation system are related. For instance, traffic speed and vehicle volume estimations for each road are highly correlated. Based on this, research on applying MTL in smart transportation systems has been studied recently. This paper reviews the recent efforts to use MTL in smart transportation systems and conducts an extensive survey to provide insights. In particular, we categorize the MTL applications in smart transportation systems into traffic forecasting, traffic sign recognition, vehicle recognition, travel time estimation, road safety estimation, taxi demand prediction, and autonomous driving. Ultimately, we discuss challenges and future research directions in applying MTL in smart transportation systems.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In an era of 5G smart cities, precise traffic prediction remains elusive due to limited real-world data. Our paper introduces a novel approach using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic traffic data that closely mimics real-world statistics. This artificial dataset enhances our new 5GT-GAN-NET-based prediction model. The result is a significant boost in prediction accuracy, with Mean Square Error (MSE) reduced to 0.000346 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to 0.00685. Compared to benchmarks, our model improves MSE and MAE by up to 95.45% with respect to the ARIMA model and 87.31% with respect to the NARNN model respectively. User privacy remains a cornerstone of our approach, crucial for smart city applications. Our predictive capabilities enable more efficient resource allocation by service providers, increasing communication infrastructure reliability. Although tailored for smart cities, the approach is adaptable to other fields facing data scarcity and privacy concerns. Our research highlights the potential of GANs in generating large, accurate datasets for traffic prediction in 5G environments while prioritizing user privacy.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting’s key challenge is to extract dynamic spatial-temporal features within intricate traffic systems. This paper introduces a novel framework for traffic prediction, named Local-Global Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (LGSTGCN). The framework consists of three core components. Firstly, a graph attention residual network layer is proposed to capture global spatial dependencies by evaluating traffic mode correlations between different nodes. The context information added in the residual connection can improve the generalization ability of the model. Secondly, a T-GCN module, combining a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), is introduced to capture real-time local spatial-temporal dependencies. Finally, a transformer layer is designed to extract long-term temporal dependence and to identify the sequence characteristics of traffic data through positional encoding. Experiments conducted on four real traffic datasets validate the forecasting performance of the LGSTGCN model. The results demonstrate that LGSTGCN can achieve good performance and be applicable to traffic forecasting tasks. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Wireless sensor network is widely explored for traffic flow prediction. Traffic forecasting is a spatio-temporal problem because of the dynamic nature of road traffic. The data collected from users for traffic prediction is often private in nature. These characteristics make it necessary to develop a framework for accurately predicting traffic flow while maintaining user data privacy. This paper proposes a Federated Learning-based spatio-temporal approach termed Fed-STGRU for traffic prediction without transmitting raw user data over the network. Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning approach incorporating techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent for data privacy preservation. The proposed scheme preserves privacy while attaining comparable accuracy and loss as the baseline algorithms, TGCN, FedAvg and FedGRU. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Traffic condition forecasting is fundamental for Intelligent Transportation Systems. Besides accuracy, many services require an estimate of uncertainty for each prediction. Uncertainty quantification must consider the inherent randomness in traffic dynamics, the so-called aleatoric uncertainty, and the additional distrust caused by data shortage, the so-called epistemic uncertainty. They together depict how predictable macroscopic traffic is. This study uses deep ensembles of graph neural networks to estimate both types of uncertainty in network-level speed forecasting. Experimental results given by the used model reveal that, although rare congestion patterns arise randomly, the short-term predictability of traffic states is mainly restricted by the irreducible stochasticity in traffic dynamics. The predicted future state bifurcates into congested or free-flowing cases. This study suggests that the potential for improving prediction models through expanding speed and flow data is limited while diversifying data types is crucial. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Traffic forecasting, a core technology within Intelligent Transportation Systems, holds broad application prospects due to its ability to accurately predict future traffic states through the modeling and analysis of complex spatio-temporal traffic data. Nevertheless, due to the complex temporal and spatial heterogeneity of traffic sequences, existing models are difficult to effectively solve the non-stationary problems caused by emergencies. To this end, this paper proposes a Quadratic Memory-Augmented Spatio-Temporal Transformer Graph Recurrent Network (QMAGRN) model based on an encoder-decoder framework. The model consists of three parts: a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, a quadratic memory-augmented (QMA) module, and a graph convolutional recurrent neural network (GCRU) decoder. Specifically, the spatio-temporal transformer encoder captures the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. We designed the QMA module to dynamically update its memory based on incoming data, enabling it to adapt to changing patterns and trends. The QMA module queries the feature information of the memory module on the time and space axis and uses the attention weighting method to perform feature fusion, thereby enhancing the encoder’s ability to capture complex spatio-temporal information. This allows the model to maintain information from earlier periods and provide context that helps understand long-term trends and changes, thereby addressing the non-stationarity of traffic data. The GCRU decoder utilizes the features generated by the QMA module as input for its recurrent units. The graph convolutional layers amalgamate historical information from neighboring nodes, thereby enhancing the spatial consistency of predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on five real datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model has achieved state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, visualizing the learned QMA module enhances the interpretability of the model.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is a research topic signified by several researchers in a league span of disciplines. Traffic flow prediction is an important aspect in Intelligent Transport Management System (ITMS). In this context, one of the most in-demand techniques of Machine Learning, especially Time series based techniques, helps in predicting traffic flow forecasting and increases the accuracy of the prediction model. In order to deliver extremely precise traffic forecasts, it is crucial that we put the prediction system into practice in the actual world. Our aim is to perform computations related to traffic on the traffic datasets and find out the accuracy for each model. For this purpose we are using three distinct time series models: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA). From the results obtained, it is concluded that the proposed model achieves highest prediction accuracy with the lowest root mean squared error. © 2024 Published by Faculty of Engineering.

AB  - Several interdisciplinary studies have investigated the impact of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) on the performance of traffic networks, which expect positive effects. Nevertheless, there will be a transitional period during which both Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs shall operate simultaneously. Adequate modeling of the interactions between CAVs and HDVs is vital to understand the mixed traffic dynamics. We propose a second-order macroscopic model by reconstructing the backward propagation speed of perturbation based on the dynamic headway distance between vehicles in mixed traffic. The proposed model is validated using microscopic simulations, and it replicates the given traffic scenarios subjected to assorted Penetration Rate (PR) of CAVs. The proposed model is employed to investigate the dynamics of mixed traffic. The results demonstrate that the average traffic velocity and the Level of Service (LOS) significantly improve with the increase in the PR of CAVs. Additionally, the performance of the proposed model is compared with the well-known Jiang-Qing-Zhu (JQZ) model, and it outperforms the JQZ model. The proposed model can be employed in traffic forecasting and real-time traffic control. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - A critical issue on the telecommunication systems relies on serving different demands of service specification in an on-demand fashion. This approach has gained more and more attention with the Internet of Things (IoT) popularity. One possibility is the co-existence of plenty of massive machine-Type communication (mMTC) users' equipment (UEs) and mission-critical ultra-reliable low latency (URLLC) UEs. The first is characterized by massive connectivity, while the latter is constrained to minimum latency and the highest reliability. Serving both services simultaneously lies in a demanding network coordination and resource allocation problem, especially on random access (RA). In this paper, we propose a novel fully RA procedure specially designed for the network traffic employed in mixed URLLC-mMTC scenarios. We characterize the access patterns from both URLLC and mMTC use modes, as well as their packet size based on 3GPP standards in which both mMTC and URLLC use modes present a long-Term traffic regularity. Taking into account such characteristics, we employ a long short-Term memory (LSTM) neural network (NN) as a traffic forecast framework. The predicted traffic is the key enabler for a novel resource slicing (RS) scheme able to fully optimize the time and frequency (T-F) grid. The RS deals with the available spectrum and time slots to efficiently assign channels to the upcoming traffic at every frame. The access procedure is performed by a modified access class barring (ACB)-based collision mitigation protocol. We present results for synthetic and real-world traffic patterns, showing the scheme is capable of fulfilling Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) requirements with high probability while keeping massive machine-Type communications (mMTC) UEs latency limited to 18 frames (180 ms).  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, Dynamic Graph (DG) representations have been increasingly used for modeling dynamic systems due to their ability to integrate both topological and temporal information in a compact representation. Dynamic graphs efficiently handle applications such as social network prediction, recommender systems, traffic forecasting, or electroencephalography analysis, which cannot be addressed using standard numerical representations. As a direct consequence, dynamic graph learning has emerged as a new machine learning problem, combining challenges from both sequential/temporal data processing and static graph learning. In this research area, the Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) has become the state-of-the-art approach and a plethora of models have been proposed in the very recent years. This paper aims to provide a review of the problems and models related to dynamic graph learning. The various dynamic graph supervised learning settings are analyzed and discussed. We identify the similarities and differences between existing models concerning the way time information is modeled. Finally, we provide guidelines for DGNN design and optimization, and review public datasets for evaluating model performance on various tasks, along with the corresponding publications.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - As an important part of the transportation industry, highway transportation, compared with other modes of transportation, has the advantages of high flexibility, wide adaptability and wide coverage. Traditional time series-based traffic forecasting is difficult to solve the problem of nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics. To solve these problems, a highway traffic forecasting method based on ARIMA–GWO–LSTM combination model is proposed. Firstly, the preliminary prediction of the UK M25 highway traffic using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) model obtains linear prediction results. Then, a highway traffic prediction model based on the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) is established, and automatic optimization of the LSTM hyperparameters is achieved through the introduction of the Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) into the traditional LSTM model, and the residuals are corrected using the LSTM model to obtain the nonlinear prediction results; the model finally combines the linear and nonlinear prediction results to obtain the predicted value of the traffic flow of the UK highway. Finally, with the help of the prediction error indexes, such as MAE, RMES, MAPE, and R2, the hybrid model is compared and analyzed with the LSTM, ARIMA, SVR, ARIMA-SVR, and ARIMA-LSTM models. The results show that the ARIMA–GWO–LSTM model reduces the MAE by 77.66%, the RMSE by 75.57%, the MAPE by 75.06%, and the R2 is closer to 1 than the single model. Verifying that the hybrid model cannot only extract long-term dependencies of data, but also effectively capture linear and nonlinear features of data, thus achieving more accurate prediction. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is the task of predicting future traffic based on historical traffic data. It is challenging due to the complex spatial-temporal correlation on road networks. Most existing research works use sequential Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to model traffic inference. However, they only focus on nodes (intersections) or edges (road segments) traffic forecasting alone. As a result, they could hardly provide a complete description of future traffic on road networks. Actually, nodes and edges traffic are interrelated. Both of them are important for traffic safety and efficiency, and neither one is negligible. In this paper, we exploit nodes and edges information together and make traffic forecasting on nodes and edges simultaneously. We propose a novel dual graph framework, called DualGraph, to model the propagation behavior of traffic on road networks. Inside our framework, we develop a DualMap block to simulate the recursive interactions between nodes and edges. The interaction process is realized by a message passing mechanism of nearby information flow. We employ the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) software to generate real-world traffic data to illustrate the effectiveness of our method. We also empirically evaluate our model on public traffic datasets. The results show that even for node or edge traffic forecasting alone, our model still outperforms compared ones, especially for long term (one hour) prediction. Author

AB  - Accurate forecasting of vessel traffic flow is crucial for establishing a smart inland waterway transportation system, ensuring real-time safety supervision, and enabling prompt emergency response. While existing methods mainly focus on temporal correlation, there is a need for research on utilizing spatiotemporal features for area vessel traffic forecasting. The study proposes a novel spatiotemporal vessel traffic fluxes prediction model called STA-BiLSTM. The model combines the Graph Attention (GAT) network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network within the GAT-LSTM framework to capture the spatial and temporal aspects of vessel traffic patterns. The proposed model incorporates the attention mechanism and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model to enhance the accuracy and robustness of ship traffic flow prediction by capturing the dependencies between time steps and waterway segments. Experimental results based on three actual Yangtze River vessel traffic flow datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over traditional approaches. Furthermore, ablation experiments validate the effective extraction of spatiotemporal dependency features between river segments by the STA-BiLSTM model. Finally, the paper showcases the significance of the proposed method through practical examples. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The accurate prediction of traffic conditions is essential for effective and efficient traffic management and control. The dynamic and complex nature of traffic data, characterized by intricate temporal and spatial features, presents significant challenges to accurate traffic forecasting. While previous studies have developed various models with advanced algorithms, they often fail to fully capture the holistic spatio-temporal features and the dynamically evolving correlations within traffic networks. Additionally, these studies often overlook the potential of adjacency matrices learned from real-time traffic data to more accurately represent the interconnectivity of nodes within road network. To address these gaps, this study introduces the Generalized Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GDSTGCN), a novel prediction model tailored for traffic data. First, this model builds a learning-based generalized dynamic graph structure, which incorporates both spatial and temporal connections and evolves with real-time traffic data. Then, a generalized dynamic graph convolution, integrated with graph diffusion, is crafted to operate on the designed generalized dynamic graph structure. This plays a critical role in holistically capturing local and global spatio-temporal traffic dependencies. Moreover, the generalized dynamic graph convolution is incorporated with Temporal convolution and other essential components, forming a cohesive framework that enables effective and efficient traffic flow predictions. To validate the performance of the GDSTGCN model, we conducted extensive experiments using four real-world road network datasets. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art GCN-based models and traditional baseline methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Crafting a dynamic and accurate resilience assessment method for urban transportation, marked by complex road networks and frequent disturbances, poses a significant challenge. Existing work mainly focuses on statically assessing historical traffic resilience and cannot dynamically divide spatial regions according to disturbance scales. In this article, we propose a predictive and multigranularity assessment method. First, we develop an attention-based spatial-temporal hypergraph neural controlled differential equation model, which can accurately predict traffic conditions under disturbances. Second, we construct a multigranularity disturbance propagation model that adaptively divides a traffic network into multiple granularities according to disturbance scales. Then, we design a real-time resilience assessment algorithm capable of quantifying spatial-temporal dynamic resilience indicators for each granularity area. Extensive experiments on urban transportation in California during heavy rainfall reveal an inverse relationship between California's resilience and rainfall intensity. In addition, its downtown exhibits strong resilience, while coastal and interior areas show relatively weaker resilience, with some interior areas experiencing prolonged recovery times.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a novel intelligent transportation framework called graph convolutional neural network for distributed machine learning (GCN-DML) is presented. Its primary application is traffic forecasting in large-scale, dynamically-evolving traffic scenarios. One unique method in traffic forecasting, called GCN-DML, is that it allows user data to be processed locally on edge devices, removing the requirement to send all data to CS (CS). Designed specifically for edge computing, this distributed machine learning framework makes it easier to train neural networks on a variety of edge devices. In addition to protecting user privacy, this method reduces the difficulties related to centralised neural network training, minimises communication delays, lowers data transfer quantities, and improves overall data processing efficiency. GCN-LSTM, the composite graph convolutional networks used in this framework, combine edge-enhanced attention mechanisms with the feature transmission capabilities of graph convolutional neural networks to effectively handle the challenging task of traffic forecasting. Even as the number of cars in the network rises, they perform exceptionally well at quickly extracting and sending interaction information between vehicles, while preserving high prediction accuracy and low time complexity. The versatility of GCN-DML is extended to a range of traffic forecasting application scenarios, whereby edge devices can adjust the kind and scale of the neural network according to available compute and storage resources, all without sacrificing performance. The usefulness of GCN-DML in traffic forecasting is demonstrated by experimental evaluations on the NGSIM public dataset, where it outperforms other models with better computation time and prediction performance. It obtains noteworthy F1 scores of 0.9473, 0.9557, and 0.9391, respectively, for recall, precision, and precision. Even when there is an increase in the number of cars, the accuracy remains high, reaching 91.21%, even with a prediction length of only 1 s. At the same time, the time complexity remains low, under 0.1 s. These findings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and potency of GCN-DML as a traffic forecasting tool for intelligent transportation systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The increasing demand for efficient resource allocation in mobile networks has catalyzed the exploration of innovative solutions that could enhance the task of real-time cellular traffic prediction. Under these circumstances, federated learning (FL) stands out as a distributed and privacy-preserving solution to foster collaboration among different sites, thus enabling responsive near-the-edge solutions. In this paper, we comprehensively study the potential benefits of FL in telecommunications through a case study on federated traffic forecasting using real-world data from base stations (BSs) in Barcelona (Spain). Our study encompasses relevant aspects within the federated experience, including model aggregation techniques, outlier management, the impact of individual clients, personalized learning, and the integration of exogenous sources of data. The performed evaluation is based on both prediction accuracy and sustainability, thus showcasing the environmental impact of employed FL algorithms in various settings. The findings from our study highlight FL as a promising and robust solution for mobile traffic prediction, emphasizing its twin merits as a privacy-conscious and environmentally sustainable approach, while also demonstrating its capability to overcome data heterogeneity and ensure high-quality predictions, marking a significant stride towards its integration in mobile traffic management systems.  © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces an innovative system and prediction model for forecasting network traffic in specific geographical locations using historical data. As Internet service providers increasingly rely on data analytics for decision-making, optimized network forecasting faces challenges such as data cleaning and preprocessing. Our approach utilizes an Artificial Recurrent Neural Network-based Modified Long Short-Term Memory model to provide continuous and precise predictions of network traffic. Notably, the proposed model outperforms conventional LSTM models, achieving a 61.9% reduction in Mean Absolute Percent Error. Our approach also integrates an interpolation technique to address the zero-component error. This further enhances the effectiveness and reliability of the model. The model promises to enhance resource utilization and lighten the load on traffic resource provisioning entities, promoting more efficient mobile network traffic management. The low training time of 3.26 min and prediction time of 0.14 s pave the way for real-time implementation of the model for network traffic forecasting and management. The comparative analysis with state-of-the-art models proves the supremacy of the proposed model. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Accurate prediction of demand for traditional taxi and ride-hailing services is crucial for addressing supply-demand imbalances. However, recent studies based on global adaptive graphs, local spatial-temporal graphs, and self-attention mechanisms struggle to effectively capture the dynamic and intricate relations in demand. Moreover, existing dynamic graph generators face challenges in efficiently producing high-quality graphs to learn the diverse interactions among zones along time axis and their shared patterns spanning various time scales. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel Local-Perception-Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Evolving Graph Transformer Network (LPE-STGTN), aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of extracting intricate local dependencies in taxi demand. Specifically, we elaborately design a spatial-temporal evolving graph generator to absorb shared and diversified inter-zone relations across different temporal periodicities and specific interactions among zones within each time step. Furthermore, an attention free transformer with local context (AFT-local) is introduced to effectively learn the correlations between adjacent time steps. Extensive experiments on three taxi datasets of New York and Beijing are carried out to evaluate the superior performance of our model. Compared with the most competitive baseline, our model achieves a balance between effectiveness and efficiency on three datasets, with average training time reduction of 70.66% and average performance improvement of 1.96%.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Recent research mainly applies deep learning (DL) methods to short-term traffic forecasting. However, there is a growing interest in long-term forecasting, which allows action optimization at more steps in the future. Motivated by the encouraging success of contrastive representation learning, we propose a powerful and light framework, namely, Traffic Representation Extraction with Contrastive learning frameworK (TRECK), to improve traffic forecasting performance, especially for longer prediction terms. TRECK i) learns disentangled seasonal representations with contrastive learning, ii) enhances the learning of event data with entity embedding and iii) improves generalization and encourages obtaining more effective representations for the forecasting task through multi-task learning. TRECK can be directly applied to typical sequence-to-sequence DL prediction models. We evaluate TRECK when integrated with vanilla base models (RNN and BiLSTM) on large-size and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that TRECK can considerably boost the performance of base models and offer them the capability of handling increasing forecasting horizons. With TRECK, even a naive model like RNN can outperform state-of-the-art Transformer-based and GNN-based methods. Moreover, while avoiding any laborious feature design, the representations extracted by TRECK are more desirable than hand-crafted time features, yielding an 18.69% lower average MAE. Further analysis highlights its efficacy in diverse traffic conditions and in generating prediction intervals. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Road traffic flow forecasting has always been of interest for researchers and engineers in fact that it plays a key role in transportation planning and engineering. Even if many traditional as well as advanced methods are in force nowadays in traffic volume forecasting, in many tropical and income countries in Africa, America and Asia, statistical approaches are used for road network and low volume road traffic forecasting. These simple and low cost methods in force now and since many years ago, are mainly focused on the annual average daily traffic (AADT) and the annual traffic growth-rate (AGR) to estimate the volume of heavy traffic that new road projects are intended to support over their lifetime. So their accuracy depends on the AADT collection, the AGR determination and models used for traffic forecasting. This paper addresses a critical need for accurate and reliable traffic forecasting in the context of road project design in Burkina Faso after nearly 40 years of the application of statistical models for road traffic forecasting and in a crisis situation as in the current case of the country where some road sections become inaccessible. The research reviews traffic forecasting methods, the context of road traffic conditions in Burkina Faso and analyses road network traffic data from 1999 to 2013 in order to fix the part of heavy traffic AADT, the trend of traffic growth and the accuracy of traffic forecasting models. In conclusion, the paper provides 34% as part of heavy traffic AADT, 5.05% and 6.20% respectively overall traffic and heavy traffic growth-rates and recommends the geometric growth model as more accurate and the integration of advanced traffic forecasting techniques in road project design. © 2024 by authors, all rights reserved.

AB  - The estimation of the amount of uncertainty featured by predictive machine learning models has acquired a great momentum in recent years. Uncertainty estimation provides the user with augmented information about the model's confidence in its predicted outcome. Despite the inherent utility of this information for the trustworthiness of the user, there is a thin consensus around the different types of uncertainty that one can gauge in machine learning models and the suitability of different techniques that can be used to quantify the uncertainty of a specific model. This subject is mostly non existent within the traffic modeling domain, even though the measurement of the confidence associated to traffic forecasts can favor significantly their actionability in practical traffic management systems. This work aims to cover this lack of research by reviewing different techniques and metrics of uncertainty available in the literature, and by critically discussing how confidence levels computed for traffic forecasting models can be helpful for researchers and practitioners working in this research area. To shed light with empirical evidence, this critical discussion is further informed by experimental results produced by different uncertainty estimation techniques over real traffic data collected in Madrid (Spain), rendering a general overview of the benefits and caveats of every technique, how they can be compared to each other, and how the measured uncertainty decreases depending on the amount, quality and diversity of data used to produce the forecasts.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This article aims to unify spatial dependency and temporal dependency in a non-Euclidean space while capturing the inner spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic data. For spatial-temporal attribute entities with topological structure, the space-time is consecutive and unified while each node's current status is influenced by its neighbors' past states over variant periods of each neighbor. Most spatial-temporal neural networks for traffic forecasting study spatial dependency and temporal correlation separately in processing, gravely impaired the spatial-temporal integrity, and ignore the fact that the neighbors' temporal dependency period for a node can be delayed and dynamic. To model this actual condition, we propose TraverseNet, a novel spatial-temporal graph neural network, viewing space and time as an inseparable whole, to mine spatial-temporal graphs while exploiting the evolving spatial-temporal dependencies for each node via message traverse mechanisms. Experiments with ablation and parameter studies have validated the effectiveness of the proposed TraverseNet, and the detailed implementation can be found from https://github.com/nnzhan/TraverseNet.  © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - New roads are being constructed all the time. However, the capabilities of previous deep forecasting models to generalize to new roads not seen in the training data (unseen roads) are rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce a novel setup called a spatio-temporal split to evaluate the models’ capabilities to generalize to unseen roads. In this setup, the models are trained on data from a sample of roads, but tested on roads not seen in the training data. Moreover, we also present a novel framework called Spatial Contrastive Pre-Training (SCPT) where we introduce a spatial encoder module to extract latent features from unseen roads during inference time. This spatial encoder is pre-trained using contrastive learning. During inference, the spatial encoder only requires two days of traffic data on the new roads and does not require any re-training. We also show that the output from the spatial encoder can be used effectively to infer latent node embeddings on unseen roads during inference time. The SCPT framework also incorporates a new layer, named the spatially gated addition layer, to effectively combine the latent features from the output of the spatial encoder to existing backbones. Additionally, since there is limited data on the unseen roads, we argue that it is better to decouple traffic signals to trivial-to-capture periodic signals and difficult-to-capture Markovian signals, and for the spatial encoder to only learn the Markovian signals. Finally, we empirically evaluated SCPT using the ST split setup on four real-world datasets. The results showed that adding SCPT to a backbone consistently improves forecasting performance on unseen roads. More importantly, the improvements are greater when forecasting further into the future.

AB  - In most recent research, the traffic forecasting task is typically formulated as a spatio-temporal graph modeling problem. For spatial correlation, they typically learn the shared pattern (i.e., the most salient pattern) of traffic series and measure the interdependence between traffic series based on a predefined graph. On the one hand, learning a specific traffic pattern for each node (traffic series) is crucial and essential for accurate spatial correlation learning. On the other hand, most predefined graphs cannot accurately represent the interdependence between traffic series because they are unchangeable while the prediction task changes. For temporal correlation, they usually concentrate on contiguous temporal correlation. Therefore, they are insufficient due to their lack of global temporal correlation learning. To overcome these aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel method named Spatio-Temporal Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (STFGCN). In the spatial aspect, we introduce a node-specific graph convolution operation to learn the node-specific patterns of each node (traffic series). Then, an adaptive adjacent matrix is introduced to represent the interdependence between traffic series. In the temporal aspect, a contiguous temporal correlation learning module is introduced to learn the contiguous temporal correlation of traffic series. Furthermore, a transformer-based global temporal correlation learning module is introduced to learn the global dependence of the traffic series. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms other competitive methods on two real-world traffic datasets (PeMSD4 and PeMSD8). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Robust travel time predictions are of prime importance in managing any transportation infrastructure, and particularly in rail networks where they have major impacts both on traffic regulation and passenger satisfaction. We aim at predicting the travel time of trains on rail sections at the scale of an entire rail network in real-time, by estimating trains’ delays relative to a theoretical circulation plan. Predicting the evolution of a given train's delay is a uniquely hard problem, distinct from mainstream road traffic forecasting problems, since it involves several hard-to-model phenomena: train spacing, station congestion and heterogeneous rolling stock among others. We first offer empirical evidence of the previously unexplored phenomenon of delay propagation at the scale of a railway network, leading to delays being amplified by interactions between trains and the network's physical limitations. We then contribute a novel technique using the transformer architecture and pre-trained embeddings to make real-time massively parallel predictions for train delays at the scale of the whole rail network (over 3000 trains at peak hours, making predictions at an average horizon of 70 min). Our approach yields very positive results on real-world data when compared to currently-used and experimental prediction techniques. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Airport planning, and therefore the development of air infrastructure, depends to a large extent on the demand forecast for the future. To plan investments in the infrastructure of an airport system and to be able to meet future needs, it is essential to predict the level and distribution of demand, both for passengers and air cargo. In the present work, a forecast was made, in the medium-long term (10 years), of the demand for passengers and air cargo, applied to a specific case study (Colombia), and where the impact on air traffic during the most severe period of the COVID-19 pandemic was taken into account. To achieve this objective, and as a methodological approach, a model of the Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) type was developed, designed to work with time series data, and widely used for feature selection, time series forecasting, and the immediate inference of the causal impact. From the results obtained, two relevant aspects can be highlighted, firstly, both demand and its growth trend will recover very soon (in just a couple of years), compared to the pre-pandemic year 2019, which was analyzed in the case study. And, secondly, the model presents very acceptable MAPE values (between 1% and 7%, depending on the variable to be forecasted), which makes the BSTS method a viable alternative methodology for calculating air traffic forecasts. © 2024 Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, urban traffic congestion is becoming more and more serious, in which the timing of signal lights for regional traffic optimization is particularly important. Since existing signal lights-based traffic optimization technologies, especially green wave, do not take the regional traffic follow into consideration, therefore not being efficient. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Signal Light Timing for Regional Traffic Optimization based on Graph Convolutional Network Empowered Traffic Forecasting. First, we propose a multi-intersection traffic flow prediction model, namely, A-GCN+ with an improved prediction accuracy of 6.3%, which utilizes the attention-aggregated graph convolutional neural networks (A-GCN) and temporal convolutional networks (TCN) to extract spatial and temporal features of the traffic flow. Second, we propose a dynamic regional traffic signal coordination optimization control method, which utilizes the predicted intersection approach traffic flow from A-GCN+ and combines it with the improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) to obtain the optimal solution for the regional average vehicle delay model. Finally, we propose a bidirectional green wave automatic control method for the main line, which utilizes the optimized results of dynamic regional traffic signal timing and employs a multi-strategy fusion graphical method to obtain the dynamic main line bidirectional green wave. Experimental results show that compared to the traditional graphical method, the multi-strategy fusion graphical method increases the green wave bandwidth by 20%. The mainline bidirectional green wave adaptive coordinated control method improves main line traffic efficiency by 32.3% and regional network traffic efficiency by 8.7%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Contrastive learning is an increasingly important research direction and has attracted considerable attention in the field of computer vision. It can greatly improve the representativeness of image features through data augmentation, unsupervised learning, and pre-trained models. However, in the field of traffic flow forecasting, most graph-based models focus on the construct of spatial–temporal relationships between road segments and ignore the use of temporal data augmentation and pre-trained models, which can improve the representation ability of the forecasting model. Therefore, in this work, contrastive learning are used to expand the distribution of sequence samples and improve the quality and generalization of forecasting models. Based on this, a novel forecasting model called contrastive learning based on multi graph convolution network (CLMGCN) is proposed, which is combined with four components: multi graph convolution network, which learns the spatial–temporal feature of the input traffic data; temporal data augmentation, which obtains the augmentation data of the input traffic data; contrastive learning, which achieves the pre-training phase and improve the quality of output feature of multi graph convolution network; output block, which utilizes the enhanced output feature of multi graph convolution network for predicting the future traffic data. Finally, by the experimental results of four public traffic flow datasets, it can be shown that CLMGCN achieves higher traffic forecasting accuracy with lower model complexity. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The rapid development of road traffic networks has provided a wealth of research data for intelligent transportation systems. We are faced with vast high-dimensional traffic flow data, characterized by complex spatio-temporal dependencies, waiting for exploration of their internal relationships. Accurately representing these spatiotemporal relationships and improving the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic prediction are critical challenges in current intelligent transportation forecasting. To tackle this issue, we propose an intelligent prediction framework for traffic flow based on the adaptive dual-graphic transformer with a cross-fusion strategy. Our aim is to uncover latent graphic feature representations that transcend temporal and spatial limitations. Furthermore, we establish a traffic spatiotemporal prediction model using a cross-fusion attention mechanism to capture dependency relationships represented by adaptive graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves superior prediction performance on practical urban traffic flow datasets compared to benchmarks, particularly for long-term predictions. Further analysis confirms its strength in balancing reliability and practicality, making it well-suited for applications in intelligent transportation systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Accurate forecasting of airline passenger traffic is important for facilitating the effective management and planning of aviation resources. In this study, we explore the air passenger traffic in the Norwegian aviation industry by collecting the passenger flow data and the corresponding measurements of the weather conditions affecting the flow from the different airports in Norway. We then proposed nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) forecasting models to predict air passenger traffic in advance. The NARX models account for the nonlinearity and nonstationarity in the passenger flow and allow the accurate forecasting of air passenger traffic. We perform experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of two variants of the NARX model and compare their performances against long short-term memory (LSTM), a deep learning method. We show that the proposed NARX model achieves the best prediction accuracy compared to LSTM, which is considered as a state-of-the-art approach for fitting sequential data. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - To fully leverage the spatiotemporal dynamic correlations in air traffic flow and enhance the accuracy of traffic flow prediction models, thereby providing a more precise basis for perceiving congestion situations in the air route network, a study was conducted on a traffic flow prediction method based on deep learning considering spatiotemporal factors. A waypoint network topology graph was constructed, and a neural network model called graph convolution and self-attention-based long short-term memory neural network (GC-SALSTM) was proposed. This model utilized waypoint flow and network efficiency loss rate as input features, with graph convolution extracting spatial features from the waypoint network. Additionally, a long short-term memory network based on a self-attention mechanism was used to extract temporal features, achieving accurate prediction of waypoint traffic. An example analysis was performed on a typical busy sector of airports in the Central and Southern China region. The effectiveness of adding the network efficiency loss rate as an input feature to improve the accuracy of critical waypoint traffic prediction was validated. The performance of the proposed model was compared with various typical prediction models. The results indicated that, with the addition of the network efficiency loss rate, the root mean square error (RMSE) for eight waypoints decreased by more than 10%. Compared to the historical average (HA), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), long short-term memory (LSTM), and graph convolution network and long short-term memory network (GCN-LSTM) models, the RMSE of the proposed model decreased by 11.78%, 5.55%, 0.29%, 2.53%, and 1.09%, respectively. This suggests that the adopted network efficiency loss rate indicator effectively enhances prediction accuracy, and the constructed model exhibits superior predictive performance in short-term waypoint traffic forecasting compared to other prediction models. It contributes to optimizing flight paths and high-altitude air routes, minimizing flight delays and airborne congestion to the greatest extent, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of the entire aviation system. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays a critical role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in smart cities. Travelers as well as urban managers rely on reliable traffic information to make their decisions for route choice and traffic management. However, noisy or missing traffic data poses a problem for accurate and robust traffic forecasting. While data-driven models such as deep neural networks can achieve high prediction accuracy with complete datasets, sensor malfunctions, and environmental effects degrade the performance of such models, as these models rely heavily on precise traffic measurements for model training and estimation. Consequently, incomplete traffic data poses a challenge for robust model design that can make accurate traffic forecasts with noisy/missing data. This research proposes the Robust Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (RT-GCN), a traffic prediction model that handles noise perturbations and missing data using a Gaussian distributed node representation and a variance based attention mechanism. Through experiments conducted on four real-world traffic datasets using diverse noisy and missing scenarios, the proposed RT-GCN model has demonstrated its ability to handle noise perturbations and missing values and provide high accuracy prediction. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Managing cellular networks in the Beyond 5G (B5G) era is a complex and challenging task requiring advanced deep learning approaches. Traditional models focusing on internet traffic (INT) analysis often fail to capture the rich temporal and spatial contexts essential for accurate INT predictions. Furthermore, these models do not account for the influence of external factors such as weather, news, and social trends. This study proposes a multi-source CNN-RNN (MSCR) model that leverages a rich dataset, including periodic, weather, news, and social data to address these limitations. This model enables the capture and fusion of diverse data sources for improved INT prediction accuracy. An advanced deep learning model, the transformer-enhanced CNN-RNN (TE-CNN-RNN), has been introduced. This model is specifically designed to predict INT data only. This model demonstrates the effectiveness of transformers in extracting detailed temporal-spatial features, outperforming conventional CNN-RNN models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSCR and TE-CNN-RNN models outperform existing state-of-the-art models for traffic forecasting. These findings underscore the transformative power of transformers for capturing intricate temporal-spatial features and the importance of multi-source data and deep learning techniques for optimizing cell site management in the B5G era. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The ISP (Internet Service Provider) industry relies heavily on internet traffic forecasting (ITF) for long-term business strategy planning and proactive network management. Effective ITF frameworks are necessary to manage these networks and prevent network congestion and over-provisioning. This study introduces an ITF model designed for proactive network management. It innovatively combines outlier detection and mitigation techniques with advanced gradient descent and boosting algorithms, including Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGB), CatBoost Regressor (CBR), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). In contrast to traditional methods that rely on synthetic datasets, our model addresses the problems caused by real aberrant ISP traffic data. We evaluated our model across varying forecast horizons—six, nine, and twelve steps—demonstrating its adaptability and superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional forecasting models. The integration of the outlier detection and mitigation module significantly enhances the model’s performance, ensuring robust and accurate predictions even in the presence of data volatility and anomalies. To guarantee that our suggested model works in real-world situations, our research is based on an extensive experimental setup that uses real internet traffic monitoring from high-speed ISP networks. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Uncertainty is an essential consideration for time series forecasting tasks. In this work, we focus on quantifying the uncertainty of traffic forecasting from a unified perspective. We develop a novel traffic forecasting framework, namely Deep Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification (DeepSTUQ), which can estimate both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Specifically, we first leverage a spatio-temporal model to model the complex spatio-temporal correlations of traffic data. Subsequently, two independent sub-neural networks maximizing the heterogeneous log-likelihood are developed to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. To estimate epistemic uncertainty, we combine the merits of variational inference and deep ensembling by integrating the Monte Carlo dropout and the Adaptive Weight Averaging re-training methods, respectively. Furthermore, to relax the Gaussianity assumption, mitigate overfitting, and improve horizon-wise uncertainty quantification performance, we define a new calibration method called Multi-horizon Conformal Calibration (MHCC). Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed unified approach based on the PAC-Bayes theory. Extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets, and the empirical results suggest that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both point prediction and uncertainty quantification.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The rise of fifth generation (5G) networks and the proliferation of internet-of-things (IoT) devices have created new opportunities for innovation and increased connectivity. However, this growth has also brought forth several challenges related to network management and security. Based on the review of literature it has been identified that majority of existing research work are limited to either addressing the network management issue or security concerns. In this paper, the proposed work has presented an integrated framework to address both network management and security concerns in 5G internet-of-things (IoT) network using a deep learning algorithm. Firstly, a joint approach of attention mechanism and long short-term memory (LSTM) model is proposed to forecast network traffic and optimization of network resources in a, service-based and user-oriented manner. The second contribution is development of reliable network attack detection system using autoencoder mechanism. Finally, a contextual model of 5G-IoT is discussed to demonstrate the scope of the proposed models quantifying the network behavior to drive predictive decision making in network resources and attack detection with performance guarantees. The experiments are conducted with respect to various statistical error analysis and other performance indicators to assess prediction capability of both traffic forecasting and attack detection model. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a critical task in intelligent transportation systems. In recent years, lots of methods have been proposed and achieved significant progress in modeling highly nonlinear and complex spatiotemporal pattern for traffic forecasting. However, most methods neglect the specific internal and external factors of the traffic system, such as the road connections, buildings surrounding each place, transfer stations, etc. The main challenges of utilizing the diverse knowledge from internal and external factors are to represent and fuse the impact of various factors. Few works use distance-based adjacency matrices to represent factors and the element-wise multiplication to fuse them, which may lead to even worse performances. In this paper, we propose to utilize knowledge graph to represent traffic system factors and design a novel neural network to exploit them for traffic foresting. First, we model the relations between factors and traffic conditions from the perspective of the knowledge graph and express them as unified triplets. Then, we generate multi-hop path features with embeddings learned from the knowledge representation model and multi-hop paths searched from the graph structure. Next, we present a knowledge-based multi-hop network (KMHNet) that uses an attention-based module to learn the correlation from multi-hop path features. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we build two real-world datasets both containing a traffic condition sub-dataset and a traffic knowledge graph. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed KMHNet outperforms eight well-known methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/2448845600/KMHNet.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Precise and reliable traffic predictions play a vital role in contemporary traffic management, particularly within complex traffic networks. Currently, the approach which utilizes static graph convolution with recurrent neural networks for traffic flow prediction fails in digging the complicated spatial and dynamic temporal correlations deeply. As a solution, we propose a dynamic graph convolution network model, aimed at enhancing traffic forecasting. Within our model, we first utilize the dynamic Laplace matrix, generated by assessing the similarity of time series changes, to facilitate graph convolution, enabling a more in-depth exploration of spatial correlations among nodes. Then, we capture local time correlations through convolutional neural networks and address long-term correlations using the self-attention mechanism. To mitigate the over-smoothing challenge related to graph fusion and deep networks, we introduce the autoregressive module to enhance the predictperformance for aperiodic sequences. Thereby, we contemplate not just the dynamic relationship between multiple time series but also the diverse facets of long-term, short-term, periodic, andnon-periodic changes inherent in time series. Experimental findings corroborate the superior performance of our proposed model compared to all benchmark models © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - With the advancement of artificial intelligence, traffic forecasting is gaining more and more interest in optimizing route planning and enhancing service quality. Traffic volume is an influential parameter for planning and operating traffic structures. This study proposed an improved ensemble-based deep learning method to solve traffic volume prediction problems. A set of optimal hyperparameters is also applied for the suggested approach to improve the performance of the learning process. The fusion of these methodologies aims to harness ensemble empirical mode decomposition’s capacity to discern complex traffic patterns and long short-term memory’s proficiency in learning temporal relationships. Firstly, a dataset for automatic vehicle identification is obtained and utilized in the preprocessing stage of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition model. The second aspect involves predicting traffic volume using the long short-term memory algorithm. Next, the study employs a trial-and-error approach to select a set of optimal hyperparameters, including the lookback window, the number of neurons in the hidden layers, and the gradient descent optimization. Finally, the fusion of the obtained results leads to a final traffic volume prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other benchmarks regarding various evaluation measures, including mean absolute error, root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, and R-squared. The achieved R-squared value reaches an impressive 98%, while the other evaluation indices surpass the competing. These findings highlight the accuracy of traffic pattern prediction. Consequently, this offers promising prospects for enhancing transportation management systems and urban infrastructure planning. © 2024 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The proliferation of e-commerce in recent years has been driven in part by the increasing ease of making purchases online and having them delivered directly to the consumer. However, these last-mile delivery logistics have become complex due to external factors (traffic, weather, etc.) affecting the delivery routes’ optimization. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) also have a challenge that contributes to the need of delivery companies for traffic sensors in urban areas. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a framework that closes the gap on accurate traffic prediction tailored for last-mile delivery logistics, leveraging social media analysis along with traditional methods. This work can be divided into two stages: (1) traffic prediction, which utilizes advanced deep learning techniques such as Graph Convolutional and Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks, as well as data from sources such as social media check-ins and Collaborative Innovation Networks (COINs); and (2) experimentation in both short- and long-term settings, examining the interactions of traffic, social media, weather, and other factors within the model. The proposed framework allows for the integration of additional analytical techniques to further enhance vehicle routing, including the use of simulation tools such as agent-based simulation, discrete-event simulation, and system dynamics. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - We study the forecasting problem for traffic with dynamic, possibly periodical, and joint spatial-temporal dependency between regions. Given the aggregated inflow and outflow traffic of regions in a city from time slots 0 to t-1, we predict the traffic at time t for any region. Prior arts in the area often considered the spatial and temporal dependencies in a decoupled manner, or were rather computationally intensive in training with a large number of hyper-parameters which needed tuning. We propose ST-TIS, a novel, lightweight and accurate Spatial-Temporal Transformer with information fusion and region sampling for traffic forecasting. ST-TIS extends the canonical Transformer with information fusion and region sampling. The information fusion module captures the complex spatial-temporal dependency between regions. The region sampling module is to improve the efficiency and prediction accuracy, cutting the computation complexity for dependency learning from O(n2) to O(nn), where n is the number of regions. With far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art deep learning models, ST-TIS's offline training is significantly faster in terms of tuning and computation (with a reduction of up to 90% on training time and network parameters). Notwithstanding such training efficiency, extensive experiments show that ST-TIS is substantially more accurate in online prediction than state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of 9.5% on RMSE, and 12.4% on MAPE compared to STDN and DSAN). © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Travel time duration and traffic forecasting in urban environments is of critical importance for efficient supply chain logistics and accurate navigation services. The paper compares data-driven statistical and machine learning approaches for urban traffic travel times forecasting on a 15-minute resolution for the next 24 hours. A detailed analysis of the available historical data is performed, including historical floating car data for a one-year period. Data analysis is followed by development and evaluation of baseline, ARIMAX, neural network and gradient boosting models. The predictions are generated on a day-ahead forecasting horizon where the machine learning models are propagated in a recursive strategy. Recursive approach implies more accurate short-term forecasts that are crucial in the context of nowcasting, while maintaining good accuracy on long-term horizons necessary for daily operation planning. The evaluation of the models accuracy is conducted on four main arterial urban routes in the city of Zagreb, Croatia, with travel times data obtained from a commercial navigation service. A detailed analysis of the results is performed, with a special focus put on the accuracy of near future predictions, as well as different models and model structures.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting has made pronounced progress with the development of graph convolution networks and the use of the topology of road networks. However, existing works face some limitations when it comes to modelling spatial dependencies. For example, pre-defined graphs rely on global information to establish spatial relationships, and the spatial receptive field is limited by the polynomial convolutional method. To address these limitations, the authors propose the Lanczos method for Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (LSTGCN); this approach uses the low-rank approximation theory to drive pre-defined graphs to collect important information and eliminate spatial redundancy. Additionally, a learnable dynamic graph feature (LDGF) module generates adaptive graphs and perceives the latent invariance-variability between graph nodes. To further improve the model's ability to capture spatial dependencies and temporal correlations, multi-span spatial learning is employed for enlarged receptive fields, which can be well integrated into gated recurrent units. The authors conducted baselines comparison and ablation experiments on real-world datasets, and the findings show that the LSTGCN model outperforms the baselines and improves prediction accuracy. Notably, this work is the first attempt to use graph low-rank theory for traffic prediction. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - In the intelligent transportation system, traffic forecasting, which is generally characterized as a graph spatial-temporal prediction task, plays a crucial role. It is challenging to generate reliable forecast results due to the complexity of traffic topological information and the inherent uncertainty of road traffic circumstances. Existing works generally focus on modeling spatial dependency on static graph structures, but ignore dynamic relations between road segments and cannot extract long-range traffic dependencies in spatial-temporal domains. To bridge the above gaps, we present a novel framework, called Dynamic Multi-Hop Graph Attention Network (DMGAN). Specifically, we leverage dynamic graph modeling to capture time-varying relations across road sections and introduce the multi-hop operation in each message propagation layer to extract long-range spatial dependency. Meanwhile, we develop a fusion-attention module, preserving both local and global hidden layer outputs of the encoder, to capture both long- and short-term temporal dependencies jointly. In this way, our method can fully model complex time-varying traffic topology information and capture the internal patterns of traffic series by integrating dynamic graph structure and temporal attention component. DGMAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in three metrics, as demonstrated by experimental findings on four real-world public traffic datasets, METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, PEMS03, and PEMS07.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Our daily lives are greatly impacted by traffic conditions, making it essential to have accurate predictions of traffic flow within a road network. Traffic signals used for forecasting are usually generated by sensors along roads, which can be represented as nodes on a graph. These sensors typically produce normal signals representing normal traffic flows and abnormal signals indicating unknown traffic disruptions. Graph convolution networks are widely used for traffic prediction due to their ability to capture correlations between network nodes. However, existing approaches use a predefined or adaptive adjacency matrix that does not accurately reflect real-world relationships between signals. To address this issue, we propose a decomposition dynamic graph convolutional recurrent network (DDGCRN) for traffic forecasting. DDGCRN combines a dynamic graph convolution recurrent network with an RNN-based model that generates dynamic graphs based on time-varying traffic signals, allowing for the extraction of both spatial and temporal features. Additionally, DDGCRN separates abnormal signals from normal traffic signals and models them using a data-driven approach to further improve predictions. Results from our analysis of six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DDGCRN compared to the current state-of-the-art.

AB  - Recently, different techniques have been applied to detect, predict, and reduce traffic congestion to improve the quality of transportation system services. Deep learning (DL) is becoming increasingly valuable for solving critiques. DL applications in transportation have been collected in several recently published surveys over the last few years. The existing research has discussed the cloud environment, which does not provide timely traffic forecasts, which is the cause of frequent traffic accidents. Thus, a solid understanding of the difficulties in predicting congestion is required because the transportation system varies widely between non-congested and congested states. This research develops a bi-directional recurrent neural network (BRNN) using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to extract and classify traffic into congested and non-congested. This research uses a bidirectional recurrent neural network to simulate and forecast traffic congestion in smart cities (BRNN). Urban regions worldwide struggle with traffic congestion, and conventional traffic control techniques have failed miserably. This research suggests a data-driven approach employing BRNN for traffic management in smart cities, which uses real-time data from sensors and linked devices to control traffic more efficiently. The primary measures include predicting traffic metrics such as speed, weather, current, and accident probability. Congestion prediction performance has also been improved by extracting more features such as traffic, road, and weather conditions. The proposed model achieved better measures than the existing state-of-the-art methods. This research also explores an overview and analysis of several early initiatives that have shown promising results; moreover, it explores two potential future research approaches to increase the accuracy and efficiency of large-scale motion prediction. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The prediction of future traffic conditions represents a main building block for traffic management. With the advent of multiple traffic and environmental sensors, diverse data for predictions are available and models may incorporate not only traffic data but also additional aspects such as local weather conditions. A review of the state-of-the art methods in short-term traffic forecasting presented in this paper reveals that machine learning (ML) algorithms from the field of deep learning are occasionally used for forecasts based on historical traffic data, but not for traffic predictions including exogenous factors. Weather conditions represent an exogenous factor, which, for example, may affect travel times. This paper investigates how short-term travel time predictions may be improved by applying deep recurrent neural networks that incorporate weather data. Therefore, two hypotheses are formulated. Hypothesis 1 tests the prediction quality of the recurrent neural network (RNN) models, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) compared to the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) prediction method. The respective results indicate that the RNN models using historical traffic data and weather data show significant improvement compared to the ARMA model using only historical traffic data. Hypothesis 2 tests the prediction quality of LSTM and GRU compared to ML-based forecast models already in place in the field of traffic predictions, namely k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector regression (SVR), and neural networks (NN). In this context, the LSTM and GRU models using historical traffic data and weather data show significant improvement compared to the models kNN, SVR, and NN that also consider weather data. Despite the results presented in this work, there is still further potential for improvement. Thus, further research focusing on hyperparameter tuning of the RNN algorithms and the optimized selection of (additional) input variables with significant influence on travel times can contribute to further improvements of the forecast quality.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is one of the most popular spatio-temporal tasks in the field of machine learning. A prevalent approach in the field is to combine graph convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks for the spatio-temporal processing. There has been fierce competition and many novel methods have been proposed. In this article, we present the method of spatio-temporal graph neural rough differential equation (STG-NRDE). Neural rough differential equations (NRDEs) are a breakthrough concept for processing time-series data. Their main concept is to use the log-signature transform to convert a time-series sample into a relatively shorter series of feature vectors. We extend the concept and design two NRDEs: one for the temporal processing and the other for the spatial processing. After that, we combine them into a single framework. We conduct experiments with 6 benchmark datasets and 27 baselines. STG-NRDE shows the best accuracy in all cases, outperforming all those 27 baselines by non-trivial margins.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - Trajectory data contains rich spatial and temporal information. Turning trajectories into graphs and then analyzing them efficiently in an AI-empowered way is a representative branch of trajectory analysis in IoV and ITS environments, which is of great significance. This research attempts to project trajectories onto road networks to predict traffic conditions. Extracting accurate spatio-temporal dependencies is the key to improving the analysis. However, two problems exist in the current study. The first one is the focus on the network structure while ignoring node features, and the second one is that the structure cannot be fully utilized. In addition, the static spatial structure may not accurately reflect the dynamic real spatial dependency. In response to these problems, a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks via View Fusion for Trajectory Data Analytics (STFGCN) model is designed. It contains two independent views: the structural view and feature view. The view fusion layer is further designed. It includes an extended graph convolutional module and a causal dilated module. The extended graph convolutional module fully extracts dynamic spatial dependencies, while the causal dilated module captures time tendencies. Stacked view fusion layers and a view fusion module perform fusion operations based on the advantages of the two views, efficiently integrating information from both. Several experiments are performed on two real-world trajectory datasets. The results show that a better prediction performance is obtained, especially on the long-range time prediction task.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is an important task for transportation engineering as it helps authorities to plan and control traffic flow, detect congestion, and reduce environmental impact. Deep learning techniques have gained traction in handling such complex datasets, but require expertise in neural architecture engineering, often beyond the scope of traffic management decision-makers. Our study aims to address this challenge by using neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These methods, which simplify neural architecture engineering by discovering task-specific neural architectures, are only recently applied to traffic prediction. We specifically focus on the performance estimation of neural architectures, a computationally demanding sub-problem of NAS, that often hinders the real-world application of these methods. Extending prior work on evolutionary NAS (ENAS), our work evaluates the utility of zero-cost (ZC) proxies, recently emerged cost-effective evaluators of network architectures. These proxies operate without necessitating training, thereby circumventing the computational bottleneck, albeit at a slight cost to accuracy. Our findings indicate that, when integrated into the ENAS framework, ZC proxies can accelerate the search process by two orders of magnitude at a small cost of accuracy. These results establish the viability of ZC proxies as a practical solution to accelerate NAS methods while maintaining model accuracy. Our research contributes to the domain by showcasing how ZC proxies can enhance the accessibility and usability of NAS methods for traffic forecasting, despite potential limitations in neural architecture engineering expertise. This novel approach significantly aids in the efficient application of deep learning techniques in real-world traffic management scenarios. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The development of smart cities has occurred over the past ten years. One primary goal of “smart city” initiatives is to lessen vehicle congestion. Several innovative technologies, including vehicular communications, navigation, and traffic control, have been created by Vehicle Networking System to address this problem. The traffic data gathered by smart devices aids in the forecasting of traffic in smart cities. This project created an Intelligent Traffic Congestion Management System (ITCMS) that uses machine learning techniques and traffic data from Kaggle to decrease the amount of time spent stuck in traffic. This study aims to assess feature selection methods and machine learning models for traffic forecasting in smart cities. The feature dimension is reduced using feature selection techniques, such information gain, correlation attribute, and principal component analysis. The recommended model successfully predicted traffic flow, assisting in the alleviation of congestion. The principal component analysis with random forest model outperforms the other machine learning models and has a 95% accuracy rate. © 2023 Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is of great importance for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Because of the intricacy implied in traffic behavior and the non-Euclidean nature of traffic data, it is challenging to give an accurate traffic prediction. Despite that previous studies considered the relationship between different nodes, the majority have relied on a static representation and failed to capture the dynamic node interactions over time. Additionally, prior studies employed RNN-based models to capture the temporal dependency. While RNNs are a popular choice for forecasting problems, they tend to be memory hungry and slow to train. Furthermore, recent studies start utilizing similarity algorithms to better express the implication of a node over the other. However, to our knowledge, none have explored the contribution of node i's past, over the future state of node j. In this paper, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Graph Mixformer (STGM) network, a highly optimized model with low memory footprint. We address the aforementioned limits by utilizing a novel attention mechanism to capture the correlation between temporal and spatial dependencies. Specifically, we use convolution layers with a variable fields of view for each head to capture long–short term temporal dependency. Additionally, we train an estimator model that express the contribution of a node over the desired prediction. The estimation is fed alongside a distance matrix to the attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we use a gated mechanism and a mixer layer to further select and incorporate the different perspectives. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model enjoys a performance gain compared to the baselines while maintaining the lowest parameter counts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate highway traffic forecasting is a critical task in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), which needs to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies from traffic sensors data. Recently, spatial-temporal graph networks have become one famous technology for various traffic forecasting tasks. Nevertheless, most of these works have assumed that the correlations between the sensors are fixed, so that it is often unable to effectively deal with the more realistic and dynamic traffic environment. To tackle this issue, we propose a joint pretraining framework for traffic flow forecasting with a gating diffusion graph attention network (JointGraph). Specifically, our proposed joint training architecture consists of two parts: network reconstructor (reconstruct a discrete graph from input data) and spatiotemporal model (forecast traffic speed with the generated network). Owing to the capabilities of the network reconstructor in generating graph structure through input node features, it is possible to apply our spatiotemporal model among multiple datasets directly. In addition, our model can expediently use information from data-rich regions and improve traffic forecasting performance on data-lacking regions in highway networks. Experiments are conducted on traffic datasets: METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and trajectory dataset: BikeNYC. The results show that our JointGraph achieves superior performance with the state-of-the-art baselines, which further indicate that our pre-training mechanism in JointGraph provides an effective solution for multi-dataset cooperative training. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Given the increasing population, urbanization, and industry, traffic congestion is particularly severe during peak hours, especially in cities. This leads to high fuel consumption, noise pollution, and a range of health problems. Consequently, traffic management is essential for managing the aforementioned concerns. This paper proposes a novel traffic prediction and control approach based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed mode-search optimization is designed by blending the particular characteristics of squawks with the theoretical foundations of traffic prediction and control optimization. Initially, the sensors are used to collect velocity, acceleration, jitter, and priority data for the network’s vehicles, after which the mode-search optimization method is suggested based on the data to cluster the vehicles. Next, for traffic projections, the possible paths are identified using a multi-objective approach. The proposed mode-search based Deep Long Short-Term Memory is then used to forecast traffic once the Deep LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) has been trained using the proposed mode-search optimization to reduce training loss. Additionally, the use of traffic signal control also improves traffic flow management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is one of the most well-studied problems in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, existing studies mainly utilize Euclidean distance or road network distance as the metrics at the spatial level, where the distance between two points is calculated based on the GPS coordinates. When using the spatial level metrics to construct the road network's topological and indexing structure, two completed unrelated road segments such as the upper and lower levels of the viaduct will be contiguous in the adjacent matrix and consequently be indexed in the same block. However, it may taking a long time to drive through these two road segments, which makes the spatial proximity meaningless, and this is pretty common during the morning and evening rush hours. Thus, it is very important to take into consideration of the temporal metric along with the spatial distance metric when dealing with the traffic forecasting problem. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel Temporal Metrics Based Aggregated Graph Convolution Network (TMAGCN), which utilize the time reachability based road network weight metric, and reveal its unique characteristics. TMAGCN mainly consists of three components: spatio-temporal reachability calculation, region clustering(road segments aggregating), and traffic flow forecasting. We explore the cluster of road segments and the reconstruction of the spatio-temporal reachability graph with temporal-level information rather than spatial-level information for better capturing the latent region information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt on this problem. The comprehensive experiments indicate that TMAGCN achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than other off-the-shelf models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is the foundation of intelligent transportation systems. Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent traffic management and urban development. However, achieving highly accurate traffic flow prediction is challenging due to road networks’ complex dynamic spatial and temporal dependencies. Previous work using predefined static adjacency matrices in graph convolutional networks needs to be revised to reflect the dynamic spatial dependencies in the traffic system. In addition, most current methods ignore the hidden dynamic spatial–temporal correlations between road network nodes as they evolve. We propose a spatial–temporal dynamic graph differential equation network (ST-DGDE) for traffic prediction to address the above problems. First, the model captures the dynamic changes between spatial nodes over time through a dynamic graph learning network. Then, dynamic graph differential equations (DGDE) are used to learn the spatial–temporal dynamic relationships in the global space that change continuously over time. Finally, static adjacency matrices are constructed by static node embedding. The generated dynamic and predefined static graphs are fused and input into a gated temporal causal convolutional network to jointly capture the fixed long-term spatial association patterns and achieve a global receiver domain that facilitates long-term prediction. Experiments of our model on two natural traffic flow datasets show that ST-DGDE outperforms other baselines. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a typical spatio-temporal graph modeling problem, which has become one of the key technical issues in modern intelligent transportation systems. However, existing methods cannot capture the long-range spatial and temporal characteristics very well because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the traffic flows. In this paper, a new deep learning framework called Graph Convolutional Dynamic Recurrent Network with Attention (GCDRNA) is proposed to predict the traffic state in the traffic network. GCDRNA mainly consists of two components, which are Graph Convolutional with Attention (GCA) block and Dynamic GRU with Attention (DGRUA) block. GCA block can capture both global and local spatial correlations of the traffic flows by k-hop GC, similarity GC and spatial attention modules. DGRUA block captures the long-term temporal correlation of the traffic flows by Dynamic GRU (DGRU) and Node Attention Unit (NAU) modules. Experimental results show that GCDRNA achieves the best prediction performance compared with other baseline models on two public real-world traffic datasets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Multivariate time series forecasting plays an important role in many domain applications, such as air pollution forecasting and traffic forecasting. Modeling the complex dependencies among time series is a key challenging task in multivariate time series forecasting. Many previous works have used graph structures to learn inter-series correlations, which have achieved remarkable performance. However, graph networks can only capture spatio-temporal dependencies between pairs of nodes, which cannot handle high-order correlations among time series. We propose a Dynamic Hypergraph Structure Learning model (DHSL) to solve the above problems. We generate dynamic hypergraph structures from time series data using the K-Nearest Neighbors method. Then a dynamic hypergraph structure learning module is used to optimize the hypergraph structure to obtain more accurate high-order correlations among nodes. Finally, the hypergraph structures dynamically learned are used in the spatio-temporal hypergraph neural network. We conduct experiments on six real-world datasets. The prediction performance of our model surpasses existing graph network-based prediction models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the DHSL model for multivariate time series forecasting. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of the modern smart city, sharing-bikes require behaviors prediction for grid-level areas which is essential for intelligent transportation systems. A model which can predict bike sharing demand behaviours accurately can allocate sharing-bikes in advance to satisfy travel demands alongside saving energy, reducing traffic, cutting down waste for those sharing-bikes companies putting excessive sharing-bikes in unsaturated demand areas. In this paper, we abandon the traditional time series prediction method and use a more efficient deep learning method to solve the traffic forecasting problem. Moreover, instead of considering spatial relation and temporal relation relatively, we produced a deep multi-view spatial-temporal network to combine them into one prediction model framework. In the experimental section, we investigate in the experiment on enormous amount of real sharing-bikes application use data in the core region of Beijing to test the performance of the model framework with a 1 km × 1 km grid-level scale and compare it with other existing machine learning approaches and prediction models. And the 4G/5G/6G communication technology facilitate the real-time control of the space-time locations of sharing bikes dynamically. Thus, it provides the basis for high-frequency analysis of space-time patterns, especially supported by the 6G large-scale application in the future.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - ime series forecasting is an important technique to study the behavior of temporal data in order to forecast the future values, which is widely applied in intelligent traffic systems (ITS). In this paper, several deep learning models were designed to deal with the multivariate time series forecasting problem for the purpose of long-term predicting traffic volume. Simulation results showed that the best forecasts are obtained with the use of two hidden long short-term memory (LSTM) layers: the first with 64 neurons and the second with 32 neurons. Over 93% of the forecasts were made with less than ±2.0% error. The analysis of variances is mainly due to peaks in some extreme conditions. For this purpose, the data was then merged between two different sources: electromagnetic loops and cameras. Data fusion is based on a calibration of the reliability of the sources according to the visibility conditions and time of the day. The integration results were then compared with the real data to prove the improvement of the prediction results in peak periods after the data fusion step. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Research in short-term traffic forecasting has been blooming in recent years due to its significant implications in traffic management and intelligent transportation systems. The unprecedented advancements in deep learning have provided immense opportunities to leverage traffic data sensed from various locations of the road network, yet significantly increased the models’ complexity and data and computational requirements, limiting the actionability of the models. Consequently, the meaningful representation of traffic flow data and the road network has been highlighted as a key challenge in improving the efficiency, as well as the accuracy and reliability of forecasting models. This paper provides a systematic review of literature dedicated to spatiotemporal traffic forecasting. Three main representation approaches are identified, namely the stacked vector, image/grid, and graph, and are critically analyzed and compared in relation to their efficiency, accuracy and associated modeling techniques. Based on the findings, future research directions in traffic forecasting are proposed, aiming to increase the adoption of the developed models in real-world applications. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Many applications rely on continual data collection to provide real-time information services, e.g., real-time road traffic forecasts. However, the collection of original data brings risks to user privacy. Recently, local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as a private data collection framework for mass population. However, for continual data collection, existing LDP schemes, e.g., those employing the memoization technique, are known to have privacy leakage on data change points over time. In this paper, we propose a new scheme with stronger privacy guarantee for continual frequency estimation under LDP, namely, Dynamic Difference Report Mechanism (DDRM). In DDRM, we introduce difference trees to capture the data changes over time, which well addresses possible privacy leakage on data change points. As for the utility enhancement, DDRM exploits the common case of no data change in time series and thereby suppresses the consumption of privacy budget in such cases. Meanwhile, an optimal privacy budget allocation scheme is proposed to encourage users to report more data for better estimation accuracy. By both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations, we show DDRM achieves highly accurate frequency estimation in real time. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Millions of residents travel by urban rail transit (URT) every day, and it is meaningful to accurately predict passenger flows for the purpose of intelligent system management. Considering the high traffic volume and complex spatial-temporal traffic patterns, accurate forecasting is quite challenging. Recently, advanced spatial-temporal graph neural networks that combine graph convolution and recurrent units have achieved superior traffic forecasting performance. However, existing methods either simply use a predefined physical network or directly learn latent static graphs by assigning a large number of trainable parameters. Moreover, they only consider capturing local temporal dependencies. However, the passenger flows of URT exhibit both physical adjacent and virtual distant spatial correlations and both local and global temporal fluctuations. In this paper, we propose a Topology Augmented Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Network (TADSTN) to fully exploit the complex spatial-temporal dependencies of passenger flows and make accurate forecasting in URT. Specifically, we first propose a virtual graph generation algorithm with no training parameters to obtain a topology-augmented URT graph, and we also sample multipattern temporal features from raw passenger flow data. Then, we propose a parallel spatial-temporal learning architecture with a time-aware global-level attention mechanism to simultaneously capture both distant and dynamic spatial dependencies and both local and global temporal dependencies of passenger flows. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our TADSTN on two real-world datasets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is a basic function of intelligent transportation systems, and the accuracy of prediction is of great significance for traffic management and urban planning. The main difficulty of traffic flow predictions is that there is complex underlying spatiotemporal dependence in traffic flow; thus, the existing spatiotemporal graph neural network (STGNN) models need to model both temporal dependence and spatial dependence. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are adopted to capture the spatial dependence in traffic flow, which can model the symmetric or asymmetric spatial relations between nodes in the traffic network. The transmission process of traffic features in GNNs is guided by the node-to-node relationship (e.g., adjacency or spatial distance) between nodes, ignoring the spatial dependence caused by local topological constraints in the road network. To further consider the influence of local topology on the spatial dependence of road networks, in this paper, we introduce Ollivier–Ricci curvature information between connected edges in the road network, which is based on optimal transport theory and makes comprehensive use of the neighborhood-to-neighborhood relationship to guide the transmission process of traffic features between nodes in STGNNs. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets show that the models with Ollivier–Ricci curvature information outperforms those based on only node-to-node relationships between nodes by ten percent on average in the RMSE metric. This study indicates that by utilizing complex topological features in road networks, spatial dependence can be captured more sufficiently, further improving the predictive ability of traffic forecasting models. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed unprecedented amounts of data generated by telecommunication (Telco) cellular networks. For example, measurement records (MRs) are generated to report the connection states between mobile devices and Telco networks, e.g., received signal strength. MR data have been widely used to localize outdoor mobile devices for human mobility analysis, urban planning, and traffic forecasting. Existing works using first-order sequence models such as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) attempt to capture spatio-temporal locality in underlying mobility patterns for lower localization errors. The HMM approaches typically assume stable mobility patterns of the underlying mobile devices. Yet real MR datasets exhibit heterogeneous mobility patterns due to mixed transportation modes of the underlying mobile devices and uneven distribution of the positions associated with MR samples. Thus, the existing solutions cannot handle these heterogeneous mobility patterns. To this end, we propose a multi-task learning-based deep neural network (DNN) framework, namely PRNet+, to incorporate outdoor position recovery and transportation mode detection. To make sure that PRNet+ can work, we develop a feature extraction module to precisely learn local-, short- and long-term spatio-temporal locality from heterogeneous MR samples. Extensive evaluation on eight datasets collected at three representative areas in Shanghai indicates that PRNet+ greatly outperforms state-of-the-arts by lower localization errors. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic congestion is a significant problem that adversely affects the economy, environment, and public health in urban areas worldwide. One promising solution is to forecast road-level congestion levels in the short-term and long-term, enabling commuters to avoid congested areas and allowing traffic agencies to take appropriate action. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep neural network algorithm based on High-Resolution Network (HRNet) and ConvLSTM decoder for 10, 30, and 60-min traffic congestion prediction. Our model utilizes the HRNet’s multi-scale feature extraction capability to capture rich spatial features from a sequence of past traffic input images. The ConvLSTM module learns temporal information from each HRNet multi-scale output and aggregates all feature maps to generate accurate traffic forecasts. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently and effectively learn both spatial and temporal relationships for traffic congestion and outperforms four other state-of-the-art architectures (PredNet, UNet, ConvLSTM, and Autoencoder) in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays an important role in urban planning. Deep learning methods outperform traditional traffic flow forecasting models because of their ability to capture spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic conditions. However, these methods require high-quality historical traffic data, which can be both difficult to acquire and non-comprehensive, making it hard to predict traffic flows at the city scale. To resolve this problem, we implemented a deep learning method, SceneGCN, to forecast traffic speed at the city scale. The model involves two steps: firstly, scene features are extracted from Google Street View (GSV) images for each road segment using pretrained Resnet18 models. Then, the extracted features are entered into a graph convolutional neural network to predict traffic speed at different hours of the day. Our results show that the accuracy of the model can reach up to 86.5% and the Resnet18 model pretrained by Places365 is the best choice to extract scene features for traffic forecasting tasks. Finally, we conclude that the proposed model can predict traffic speed efficiently at the city scale and GSV images have the potential to capture information about human activities. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.

AB  - Telecommuting has reached unprecedented levels in Japan, previously established due to the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, there is a lack of in-depth research on telecommuting frequency from the perspective of the post-pandemic era. Hence, this study investigated the relationship between employees’ expected levels of telecommuting allowed by the company and their preferred telecommuting frequency after the pandemic using an ordered response probit model with a correlation effect. Data were collected through an online questionnaire in three major metropolitan areas of Japan; the questionnaire included questions on sociodemographic, commuting, household, and work-related characteristics. The findings revealed that work-environment characteristics are prime factors influencing both expected and preferred telecommuting frequency; therefore, a telecommuting-oriented work environment is crucial for bridging the gap between employees and employers regarding telecommuting. Also, the results indicated that the preferred level of telecommuting is unattainable probably due to a lack of support from the company. Finally, a gap was identified between the expected telecommuting frequency that companies would allow and the preferred telecommuting frequency. This study provides implementations to achieve a work environment better adapted to the post-pandemic era and contributes to the establishment of future traffic forecasting models that enable effective mobility management through telecommuting. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - With the rapid development of telecommunication networks, the predictability of network traffic is of significant interest in network analysis and optimization, bandwidth allocation, and load balancing adjustment. Consequently, in recent years, significant research attention has been paid to forecasting telecommunication network traffic. Telecommunication traffic forecasting problems can be considered a time-series problem, wherein periodic historical data is fed as the input to a model. Time-series forecasting approaches are broadly categorized as statistical machine learning (ML) methods and their combinations. Statistical approaches forecast linear characteristics of time-series data, unable to capture nonlinear and complex patterns. ML-based approaches can model nonlinear characteristics of data. In recent years, hybrid approaches combining statistical and ML-based approaches have been widely used to model linear and nonlinear data characteristics. However, the performance of these approaches highly depends on feature selection techniques and hyper-parameter tuning of ML methods. A novel hybrid method is proposed for short-term traffic forecasting based on feature selection and hyperparameter optimization to address this problem. It combines statistical and ML methods to model linear and nonlinear components of data. First, a novel feature selection technique, modified mutual information based on a linear combination of targets, is proposed to find the candidate input variables. Next, a combination of vector auto regressive moving average (VARMA), long short-term memory (LSTM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), called VARMA-LSTM-MLP forecaster, is suggested to forecast short-term traffic. A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, composed of firefly and BAT, is employed to find the optimal set of hyper-parameter values. The proposed method is assessed by a real-world dataset containing Tehran city's daily telecommunication data in IRAN. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of mean squared error and mean absolute error. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we study the problem of traffic forecasting, which aims to predict the future traffic state of the road network. One key challenge is that the previous approaches lack discussion of capturing temporal dependencies, as well as spatial dependencies among locations in the traffic network. In addition, the long-term traffic prediction is not satisfied. In this paper, we propose a Traffic dYnamic gRaph modEl — TYRE — which is composed of a Graph Convolutional Network with Gated and Attention mechanisms. TYRE can learn the ‘importance’ of all adjacent and distant locations, control the aggregation of adjacent and distant neighbourhood information, and learn the temporal dependencies to support long effective historical sizes. We demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our approach on two different traffic datasets (i.e., PeMSD4 and PeMSD8). The result shows that compared to the related approaches, our model that captures temporal and spatial dependence yields substantially improved performance. When predicting traffic conditions for the next 120 min, on PeMSD8 dataset, our model shows almost 6.6% RMSE improvement, 10.9% MAE improvement, and 2.1% MAPE improvement over the previous state of the art.

AB  - This study proposes a reliable and efficient real-time forecasting platform for use in an accident-prone large-scale transportation network. We showed the method could be applied to various roadway sections without any loss of performance or efficiency. Due to its robustness, efficiency, and versatility, the method could be implemented in the Seoul Metropolitan Area to provide traffic authorities and road users with future traffic information even under accident conditions. This is the major contribution of this research and contrasts with state-of-the-art techniques proposed by prior studies, which rely heavily on parameter tuning with large historical datasets and produce only site-specific forecasts with limited prediction horizons under recurrent traffic conditions. The proposed method makes no assumptions about the physical structure of the transportation network and can be applied to different roads under different traffic conditions without time constraints. © 2023, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Traffic prediction is a challenging topic in urban traffic construction and management due to its complex dynamic spatial–temporal correlations. Currently, graph neural network achieves good results in traffic prediction, but the existing methods usually do not take into account the multi-layer information of the graph and the redundant transmission of information. Moreover, they do not consider the over-smoothing of the graph. In this paper, we propose a novel graph dropout self-learning hierarchical graph convolution network (DHGCN). Firstly, we design a self-learning hierarchical graph convolution network, which captures spatial features at different layers through multiple self-learning dynamic graphs and avoids redundant information transmission. Secondly, a novel graph dropout structure is proposed to sparsify the graph and avoid the over-smoothing of the graph. Meanwhile, an encoder–decoder architecture with gated residuals is designed to capture dynamic temporal features. In addition, this paper addresses two important traffic forecasting tasks: traffic flow and traffic speed. Extensive experiments with six real-world datasets verify that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both traffic flow and traffic speed and consistently outperforms baselines. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the field of traffic forecasting, methods based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) are emerging. But existing methods still have limitations due to insufficient sharing patterns, inflexible temporal relations and static relation assumptions. To address these issues, a Generic Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GDGCN) for traffic flow forecasting is proposed. A generic framework with both parameter-sharing and independent blocks across stacked layers is proposed to explore parameter sharing systematically in all data dimensions, which can exploit distinct patterns from layer to layer and stable patterns across layers simultaneously. Then, we design a novel temporal graph convolutional block to view historical time slots as nodes in graph perspective and handle temporal dynamics with graph convolution. This temporal convolutional block can capture flexible and global temporal relations to have a better understanding of current traffic conditions. Lastly, a dynamic graph constructor is proposed to model not only the time-specific spatial dependencies between nodes, but also the changing temporal interactions between time slots to discover dynamic relations from data thoroughly. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that GDGCN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods, but also obtains interpretable dynamic spatial relations of segments.

AB  - Spatio-temporal forecasting has a wide range of applications in smart city efforts, such as traffic forecasting and air quality prediction. Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (GCRNN) are the state-of-the-art methods for this problem, which learn temporal dependencies by RNNs and exploit pairwise node proximity to model spatial dependencies. However, the spatial relations in real data are not simply pairwise but sometimes in a higher order among multiple nodes. Moreover, spatio-temporal sequences deriving from nature are often regulated by known or unknown physical laws. GCRNNs rarely take into account the underlying physics in real-world systems, which may result in degenerated performance. To address these issues, we devise a general model called Mixed-Order Relation-Aware RNN (MixRNN+) for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, our MixRNN+ captures the complex mixed-order spatial relations of nodes through a newly proposed building block called Mixer, and simultaneously addressing the underlying physics by the integration of a new residual update strategy. Experimental results on three forecasting tasks in smart city applications (including traffic speed, taxi flow, and air quality prediction) demonstrate the superiority of our model against the state-of-the-art methods. We have also deployed a cloud-based system using our method as the bedrock model to show its practicality.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting and the utilisation of historical data are essential for intelligent and efficient resource management, particularly in optical data centre networks (ODCNs) that serve a wide range of applications. In this research, we investigate the challenge of traffic aggregation in ODCNs by making use of exact or predictable knowledge of application-certain data and demands, such as waiting time, bandwidth, traffic history, and latency. Since ODCNs process a wide range of flows (including long/elephant and short/mice), we employ machine learning (ML) to foresee time-varying traffic and connection blockage. In order to improve energy use and resource distribution in spatially mobile optical networks, this research proposes a novel method of network traffic analysis based on machine learning. Here, we leverage network monitoring to inform resource allocation decisions, with the goal of decreasing traffic levels using short-term space multiplexing multitier reinforcement learning. Then, the energy is optimised by using dynamic gradient descent division multiplexing. Various metrics, including accuracy, NSE (normalised square error), validation loss, mean average error, and probability of bandwidth blockage, are used in the experiment. Finally, using the primal–dual interior-point approach, we investigate how much weight each slice should have depending on the predicted results, which include the traffic of each slice and the distribution of user load. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper presents a novel framework for predicting metro passenger flow that is both interpretable and computationally efficient. The proposed method first uses a correlation-based spatiotemporal feature selection strategy (Cor-STFS) to identify the optimal input scheme for the prediction model, effectively reducing unnecessary interference. The framework then introduces a new multivariate passenger flow prediction architecture called STA-PTCN-BiGRU, which combines a spatiotemporal attention (STA) mechanism, parallel temporal convolutional networks (PTCN), and bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to capture the dynamic internal patterns of passenger flow. By utilising parallel computing, this architecture significantly reduces resource consumption. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using four datasets from the Shanghai Metro. Experimental results show that the new method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), achieving average reductions of 9.98%, 8.08%, and 13.29% in these metrics, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Accompanied with the development of green wireless communication, the green Internet of Vehicles (GIoV) has been a latent solution for future transportation. Among them, intelligent traffic forecasting for key nodes in GIoV is a significant research topic. Much research had been devoted to this issue, and graph learning-based approaches seemed to be a promising solution. However, existing research works concentrated more on graph-structured features in GIoV yet neglected global reliability. To deal with such issue, this work combines both deep embedding and graph embedding together and proposes a deep collaborative intelligence-driven traffic forecasting model in GIoV. By establishing more reliable feature spaces for traffic flow prediction, forecasting efficiency is expected to be promoted. Specifically, deep embedding is utilized to generate more abstract representation for basic features of road networks, and graph embedding is employed to update feature representation for different timestamps. Their collaboration contributes to considerable reliability. In addition, experiments are also conducted on a real-world dataset, and the results indicate that forecasting deviation receives about 15%-25% reduction. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Multi-step traffic forecasting has always been extremely challenging due to constantly changing traffic conditions. Advanced Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used to extract spatial information from traffic networks. Existing GCNs for traffic forecasting are usually shallow networks that only aggregate two- or three-order node neighbor information. Because of aggregating deeper neighborhood information, an over-smoothing phenomenon occurs, thus leading to the degradation of model forecast performance. In addition, most existing traffic forecasting graph networks are based on fixed nodes and therefore need more flexibility. Based on the current problem, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Deeper Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ADSTGCN), a new traffic forecasting model. The model addresses over-smoothing due to network deepening by using dynamic hidden layer connections and adaptively adjusting the hidden layer weights to reduce model degradation. Furthermore, the model can adaptively learn the spatial dependencies in the traffic graph by building the parameter-sharing adaptive matrix, and it can also adaptively adjust the network structure to discover the unknown dynamic changes in the traffic network. We evaluated ADSTGCN using real-world traffic data from the highway and urban road networks, and it shows good performance. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate traffic pattern prediction in large-scale networks is of great importance for intelligent system management and automatic resource allocation. System-level mobile traffic forecasting has significant challenges due to the tremendous temporal and spatial dynamics introduced by diverse Internet user behaviors and frequent traffic migration. Spatial-temporal graph modeling is an efficient approach for analyzing the spatial relations and temporal trends of mobile traffic in a large system. Previous research may not reflect the optimal dependency by ignoring inter-base station dependency or pre-determining the explicit geological distance as the interrelationship of base stations. To overcome the limitations of graph structure, this study proposes an adaptive graph convolutional network (AGCN) that captures the latent spatial dependency by developing self-adaptive dependency matrices and acquires temporal dependency using recurrent neural networks. Evaluated on two mobile network datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms other baselines and reduces the mean absolute error by 3.7 % and 5.6 % compared to time-series based approaches.  © China Communications Magazine Co., Ltd.

AB  - Correctly capturing the spatial-temporal correlation of traffic sequences will benefit to make accurate predictions of the future traffic states. In the paper, the methods of enhancing road spatial and temporal information representation are proposed. Firstly, the parameter matrix of each road is constructed to represent the road-specific traffic patterns for the graph convolution neural network and the recurrent neural network. Then, the node embedding, and matrix factorization are used to reduce the scale of the parameter matrix. Secondly, the node embedding-based Data Adaptive Graph Generation model was introduced to infer the indirect relationship of each node, and the gating mechanism is designed to control the weights of the direct spatial information and the indirect spatial information. Thirdly, to enhance the traffic sequence representation, the time tag and peak tag for the sequences are designed at each sampling moment. At last, the Enhanced Road Information Representation in Graph Recurrent Network (En-GRN) is proposed to predict traffic speed, and the prediction performance is tested on SZ-taxi and Los-loop dataset. The experimental results show that the presented works are effective for improving traffic prediction accuracy. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Dynamic graphs arise in various real-world applications, and it is often welcomed to model the dynamics in continuous time domain for its flexibility. This paper aims to design an easy-to-use pipeline (EasyDGL which is also due to its implementation by DGL toolkit) composed of three modules with both strong fitting ability and interpretability, namely encoding, training and interpreting: i) a temporal point process (TPP) modulated attention architecture to endow the continuous-time resolution with the coupled spatiotemporal dynamics of the graph with edge-addition events; ii) a principled loss composed of task-agnostic TPP posterior maximization based on observed events, and a task-aware loss with a masking strategy over dynamic graph, where the tasks include dynamic link prediction, dynamic node classification and node traffic forecasting; iii) interpretation of the outputs (e.g., representations and predictions) with scalable perturbation-based quantitative analysis in the graph Fourier domain, which could comprehensively reflect the behavior of the learned model. Empirical results on public benchmarks show our superior performance for time-conditioned predictive tasks, and in particular EasyDGL can effectively quantify the predictive power of frequency content that a model learns from evolving graph data. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic prediction is important in applications such as traffic management, route planning, and traffic flow optimization. Traffic speed prediction is an important part of traffic forecasting, which has always been a challenging problem due to the complexity and dynamics of traffic systems. In order to predict traffic speed more accurately, we propose a traffic speed prediction model based on a multi-head attention mechanism and weighted adjacency matrix: MAT-WGCN. MAT-WGCN first uses GCN to extract the road spatial features in the weighted adjacency matrix, and it uses GRU to extract the correlation between speed and time from the original features. Then, the spatial features extracted by GCN and the temporal features extracted by GRU are fused, and a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to integrate spatiotemporal features, collect and summarize spatiotemporal road information, and realize traffic speed prediction. In this study, the prediction performance of MAT-WGCN was tested on two real datasets, EXPY-TKY and METR-LA, and compared with the performance of traditional methods such as HA and SVR that do not combine spatial features, as well as T-GCN, A3T-GCN, and newer methods such as GCN and NA-DGRU that combine spatial features. The experimental results demonstrate that MAT-WGCN can capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of road conditions, thus enabling accurate traffic speed predictions. Furthermore, the incorporation of a multi-head attention mechanism significantly enhances the robustness of our model. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, traffic forecasting has gradually become a core component of smart cities. Due to the complex spatial-temporal correlation of traffic data, traffic flow prediction is highly challenging. Existing studies are mainly focused on graphical modeling of fixed road structures. However, this fixed graphical structure cannot accurately capture the relationship between different roads, affecting the accuracy of long-term traffic flow prediction. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes a modeling framework STN-GCN for spatial-temporal normalized graphical convolutional neural networks. In terms of temporal dependence, spatial-temporal normalization was used to divide the data into high-frequency and low-frequency parts, allowing the model to extract more distinct features. In addition, fine data input to the temporal convolutional network (TCN) was used in this module to conduct more detailed temporal feature extraction so as to ensure the accuracy of long-term sequence extraction. In addition, the transformer module was added to the model, which captured the real-time state of traffic flow by extracting spatial dependencies and dynamically establishing spatial correlations through a self-attention mechanism. During the training process, a curriculum learning (CL) method was adopted, which provided optimized target sequences. Learning from easier targets can help avoid getting trapped in local minima and yields better generalization performance to more accurately approximate global minima. As shown by experimental results the model performed well on two real-world public transportation datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are gaining attraction in large cities for better traffic management. Traffic forecasting is an important part of ITS, but a difficult one due to the intricate spatiotemporal relationships of traffic between different locations. Despite the fact that remote or far sensors may have temporal and spatial similarities with the predicting sensor, existing traffic forecasting research focuses primarily on modeling correlations between neighboring sensors while disregarding correlations between remote sensors. Furthermore, existing methods for capturing spatial dependencies, such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs), are unable to capture the dynamic spatial dependence in traffic systems. Self-attention-based techniques for modeling dynamic correlations of all sensors currently in use overlook the hierarchical features of roads and have quadratic computational complexity. Our paper presents a new Dynamic Graph Convolution LSTM Network (DyGCN-LSTM) to address the aforementioned limitations. The novelty of DyGCN-LSTM is that it can model the underlying non-linear spatial and temporal correlations of remotely located sensors at the same time. Experimental investigations conducted using four real-world traffic data sets show that the suggested approach is superior to state-of-the-art benchmarks by 25% in terms of RMSE. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for smart city development in the new era. However, the intricate spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data present significant challenges for prediction accuracy. Existing methods often rely on predefined adjacency matrices to capture Spatio-temporal dependencies, which may not adapt well to the dynamic nature of road traffic. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Spatio-temporal Fusion Graph Recurrent Network (MSTFGRN). This innovative approach introduces a data-driven method for generating a weighted adjacency matrix, effectively capturing real-time spatial dependencies that are not adequately captured by predefined matrices. The MSTFGRN also incorporates a novel two-way Spatio-temporal fusion operation to learn hidden dependencies between parallel Spatio-temporal relations at different time points. Additionally, a global attention mechanism is integrated into the Spatio-temporal fusion module, enabling the simultaneous capture of global Spatio-temporal dependencies. Through extensive trials on publicly available highway traffic datasets, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to alternative baselines. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Predicting traffic is the main duty of an intelligent transportation system (ITS). Precise traffic forecasts can significantly enhance the use of public funds. However, the dynamic and complex nature of spatio-temporal relationships presents significant challenges. Most current methods utilize static adjacency matrices, leading to reduced forecasting accuracy and precision. This approach fails to account for the complex spatio-temporal correlations that interact simultaneously. In order to show how different spatio-temporal correlations change over time in the traffic flow network, this study suggests a unified simultaneous Multi Fusion Graph Network (DMFGNet) model. The goal of the suggested DMFGNet model is to identify dynamic spatio-temporal linkages between various regions. Meanwhile, we propose a model, the Spatio-Temporal Attention Unit (STAU), to control the weights of neighbor aggregation. It is capable of meticulously combining spatio-temporal characteristics from different neighbors. We tested the model for both real-time and pre-processed predictions using a combination of edge and cloud infrastructure. This setup performs prediction tasks at the edge layer and conducts training in the remote cloud. This approach guarantees the use of only relevant data for model training and prediction-making, thereby boosting the system's overall effectiveness. This approach not only optimizes resource allocation but also aids in reducing latency and enhancing the overall performance of cloud-based prediction models, potentially enhancing the capabilities of consumer technology and electronics solutions. We carefully tested and evaluated two large real-world traffic flow datasets to show that the proposed method works and is useful. The results of the tests show that the suggested model is better than the current best baseline methods. Additionally, the results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the recommended strategy.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting, as a fundamental and challenging problem of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), has always been the focus of researchers. Nevertheless, accurate traffic forecasting still exists some problems due to the complex spatial-temporal dependencies and irregularities of traffic flows. Most of the existing methods typically use the spatial adjacency matrix and complicated mechanism to model spatial-temporal relationships separately, while ignoring the latent spatial-temporal correlations. In this paper, a novel architecture is proposed named spatial-temporal correlation graph convolutional networks (STCGCN) for traffic prediction. First, an informative fused graph structure is constructed to better learn the complex spatial-temporal correlations, which breaks the limitation that the general spatial adjacency matrix cannot reflect temporal correlations. Moreover, spatial-temporal correlation graph convolution and gated temporal convolution are performed in parallel and they are integrated into a unified layer, which enables capturing both local and global spatial-temporal dependencies simultaneously. By stacking multiple layers, STCGCN can learn more long-range spatial-temporal dependencies. Experimental results on five public traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed STCGCN in urban traffic forecasting. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Recently, Temporal Convolution Networks(TCNs) and Graph Convolution Network(GCN) have been developed for traffic forecasting and obtained promising results as their capability of modeling the spatial and temporal correlations of traffic data. However, few of existing studies are satisfied with both long and short-term prediction tasks. Recent research has shown the superiority of transformer in handling long-range time series forecasting problems. Aimed at the shortcoming of existing solutions, in this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-enhanced Temporal Convolution Network(TE-TCN) to capture spatial, long and short-term periodical dependencies to improve the accuracy of traffic flow forecasting, especially for long-term prediction. TE-TCN integrates transformer multi-head attention mechanism and GRU to discover the long-term periodic patterns. Meanwhile, two paralleled temporal convolution networks are applied to solve the short-term periodic dependencies. The proposed method is evaluated by extensive traffic forecasting experiments on four real-world datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that TE-TCN outperforms the state-of-the-art related methods, especially for long-term traffic flow forecasting. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate server traffic prediction can help enterprises formulate network resource allocation strategies in advance and reduce the probability of network congestion. Traditional prediction models ignore the unique data characteristics of server traffic that can be used to optimize the prediction model, so they often cannot meet the long-term and high-precision prediction required by server traffic prediction. To solve this problem, this paper establishes a hybrid model ARIMA-LSTM-CF, which combines the advantages of linear and nonlinear models, as well as the periodic fluctuation characteristics of server traffic data obtained from banks. In addition, this paper also uses the optimized K-means clustering method to extract the traffic data of workdays and non workdays. The results show that the new hybrid model performs better than the single ARIMA and LSTM models in predicting the long-term trend of server traffic. RMSE (root mean square error) and MAE (mean absolute error) are reduced by 50%. R2 score index reached 0.64. The results show that the model can effectively extract the data characteristics of server traffic data, and the model has accurate and stable long-term prediction ability. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Accurate and real-time traffic forecasting is of great significance for urban traffic planning, traffic control, and traffic management. However, the time-varying dynamic spatial relations and the complicated spatial–temporal dependencies are still open problems to be considered in traffic forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a graph convolutional recurrent network for traffic forecasting with a dynamic adjacency matrix within an encoder–decoder framework, named DAGCRN. The DAGCRN consists of a spatial relation extraction module (SREM), an adjacency matrix update module (AMUM), a dynamic graph convolutional recurrent module (DGCRM), and a global temporal attention module (GTAM). Specifically, SREM and AMUM are proposed to capture nodes’ mutual relations at each time step and to model the evolution of the dynamic adjacency matrix, respectively. DGCRM captures the spatial–temporal dependencies of traffic data based on dynamic graph convolution and gated recurrent unit. GTAM is designed to extract the long-range temporal dependencies between future time steps and historical time steps. Extensive experiments on two real-world traffic speed datasets demonstrate that the proposed DAGCRN outperforms a number of representative baselines consistently. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fifth-generation (5G) networks require efficient radio resource management (RRM) which should dynamically adapt to the current network load and user needs. Monitoring and forecasting network performance requirements and metrics helps with this task. One of the parameters that highly influences radio resource management is the profile of user traffic generated by various 5G applications. Forecasting such mobile network profiles helps with numerous RRM tasks such as network slicing and load balancing. In this paper, we analyze a dataset from a mobile network operator in Portugal that contains information about volumes of traffic in download and upload directions in one-hour time slots. We apply two statistical models for forecasting download and upload traffic profiles, namely, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and Holt-Winters models. We demonstrate that both models are suitable for forecasting mobile network traffic. Nevertheless, the SARIMA model is more appropriate for download traffic (e.g., MAPE [mean absolute percentage error] of 11.2% vs. 15% for Holt-Winters), while the Holt-Winters model is better suited for upload traffic (e.g., MAPE of 4.17% vs. 9.9% for SARIMA and Holt-Winters, respectively). © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - With the development of intelligent transportation technology, road travel time prediction has become an important research direction. Owing to the complex periodic dependence and non-linear features of road travel time series, achieving accurate and effective predictions remains a challenging task. Most existing traffic sequence prediction methods lack modelling of the dynamic correlation between multiple period information, resulting in unsatisfactory prediction results. To address this, a multi-component attention graph convolutional network (MCAGCN) is proposed for road travel time prediction. First, the spatial-temporal features of three historical components (hourly, daily and weekly) are modelled individually. A skip attention layer is then used to fuse multi-scale spatial-temporal features to enhance the model's feature extraction capabilities. Secondly, a component attention layer is proposed to calculate the correlation between different components using the temporal features of the prediction moment, to achieve dynamic modelling between different period information. The experimental results on the Tianchi, METR-LA, and PeMS-BAY datasets, which are real-world traffic forecasting datasets, demonstrate the superiority of MCAGCN. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The evolution of communication systems always follows data traffic evolution and further influences innovations that are unlocking new markets and services. While 5G deployment is still ongoing in various countries, data-driven considerations (extracted from forecasts at the macroscopic level, detailed analysis of live network traffic patterns, and specific measures from terminals) can conveniently feed insights suitable for many purposes (B2B e.g., operator planning and network management; plus also B2C e.g., smarter applications and AI-aided services) in the view of future 6G systems. Moreover, technology trends from standards and research projects (such as Hexa-X) are moving with industry efforts on this evolution. This paper shows the importance of data-driven insights, by first exploring network evolution across the years from a data point of view, and then by using global traffic forecasts complemented by data traffic extractions from a live 5G operator network (statistical network counters and measures from terminals) to draw some considerations on the possible evolution toward 6G. It finally presents a concrete case study showing how data collected from the live network can be exploited to help the design of AI operations and feed QoS predictions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is a critical function of intelligent transportation systems, which remains challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal dependence of traffic data. GNN-based traffic forecasting models typically utilize predefined graphical structures based on prior knowledge and do not adapt well to dynamically changing traffic characteristics, which may limit their performance. The transformer is a compelling architecture with an innate global self-attention mechanism, but cannot capture low-level detail very well. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Gated Hybrid Transformer Network (STGHTN), which leverages local features from temporal gated convolution, spatial gated graph convolution respectively and global features by transformer to further improve the traffic flow forecasting results. First, in the temporal dimension, we take full advantage of the local properties of temporal gated convolution and the global properties of transformer to effectively fuse short-term and long-term temporal dependence. Second, we mutually integrate two modules to complement each representation by utilizing spatial gated graph convolution to extract local spatial dependence and transformer to extract global spatial dependence. Furthermore, we propose a multi-graph model that constructs a road connection graph, a similarity graph, and an adaptive dynamic graph to exploit the static and dynamic associations between road networks. Experiments on four real datasets confirm the proposed method’s state-of-the-art performance.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting technology plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. Based on graph neural networks and attention mechanisms, most previous works utilize the transformer architecture to discover spatiotemporal dependencies and dynamic relationships. However, they have not thoroughly considered correlation information among spatiotemporal sequences. In this paper, based on the maximal information coefficient, we present two elaborate spatiotemporal representations, spatial correlation information (SCorr) and temporal correlation information (TCorr). Using SCorr, we propose a correlation information-based spatiotemporal network (CorrSTN) that includes a dynamic graph neural network component for integrating correlation information into spatial structure effectively and a multi-head attention component for modeling dynamic temporal dependencies accurately. Utilizing TCorr, we explore the correlation pattern among different periodic data to identify the most relevant data, and then design an efficient data selection scheme to further enhance model performance. The experimental results on the highway traffic flow (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07 and PEMS08) and metro crowd flow (HZME inflow and outflow) datasets demonstrate that CorrSTN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance. In particular, on the HZME (outflow) dataset, our model makes significant improvements compared with the ASTGNN model by 13.2%, 15.3% and 29.3% in the metrics of MAE, RMSE and MAPE, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With the development of social economy and smart technology, the explosive growth of vehicles has caused traffic forecasting to become a daunting challenge, especially for smart cities. Recent methods exploit graph spatial–temporal characteristics, including constructing the shared patterns of traffic data, and modeling the topological space of traffic data. However, existing methods fail to consider the spatial position information and only utilize little spatial neighborhood information. To tackle above limitation, we design a Graph Spatial–Temporal Position Recurrent Network (GSTPRN) architecture for traffic forecasting. We first construct a position graph convolution module based on self-attention and calculate the dependence strengths among the nodes to capture the spatial dependence relationship. Next, we develop approximate personalized propagation that extends the propagation range of spatial dimension information to obtain more spatial neighborhood information. Finally, we systematically integrate the position graph convolution, approximate personalized propagation and adaptive graph learning into a recurrent network (i.e. Gated Recurrent Units). Experimental evaluation on two benchmark traffic datasets demonstrates that GSTPRN is superior to the state-of-art methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Network Slicing is an enabler for new use cases and an improved network performance, especially for 5G private networks, which opens new business opportunities for vendors and applications for customers. On the other hand, the slicing mechanism adds another level of complexity to network management that significantly increases total cost of ownership. Full automation is a must, which is also evident in the standardization work on autonomous and zero-touch mobile networks under the umbrella of 3GPP and ITU organizations. Moreover, there is a clear methodological gap in research related to mobile network slicing, i.e. capacity dimensioning and planning for such infrastructure. The concept of the network modeling tool has been updated with an emphasis on adding functionality of mobile network capacity dimensioning and planning, which is presented in this article. Data-driven framework with thoroughly verified methods is outlined (e.g., Prophet, Neural Networks, VARMAX and its univariate equivalent - ARMA). Special attention is paid to traffic forecasting as the basis for the dimensioning and planning process. We evaluate how to use the framework as a scenario simulator to estimate the impact of traffic changes in any slice on quality of service (namely throughput and delay) of all. Finally, we explain how this solution realizes the concept of Digital Twin-based network simulator.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Over the past few years, there has been significant research on applying Transformer models to time series prediction, yielding promising results. Simultaneously, researchers have begun exploring the utilization of Transformers for traffic prediction in order to mitigate the nonlinear spatial–temporal correlation inherent in traffic data. Some of these studies have attempted to characterize spatial–temporal features by incorporating embedding structures, with the goal of improving performance of the model. However, existing methods have not adequately addressed the issue of spatial–temporal correlation. To address these limitations, we propose the Transformer Network with Decoupled Spatial–Temporal Embedding (DSTET) model for traffic flow prediction. The key aspect of our model is its ability to effectively decouple the spatial and temporal embedding through the implementation of the Decoupled Spatial–Temporal Embedding structure. This structure enhances the characterization of spatial–temporal features, ultimately improving the performance of traffic prediction based on the Transformer model. Through experiments conducted on six real-world traffic datasets, our model consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, demonstrating its capability to address the identified problems. Moreover, we substantiate the efficacy of the suggested components via ablation experiments and furnish a thorough analysis of the attention weight matrix to clarify the functioning of the model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The emergence of smart cities has addressed many critical challenges associated with conventional urbanization worldwide. However, sustainable traffic management in smart cities has received less attention from researchers due to its complex and heterogeneous nature, which directly affects smart cities’ transportation systems. The study aimed at addressing traffic-related issues in smart cities by focusing on establishing a sustainable framework based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. To sustain the management of traffic in smart cities, which is composed of a hybridized stream of human-driven vehicles (HDV) and connected automated vehicles (CAV), a dual approach was employed by considering traffic as either modeling- and analysis-based, or/and the decision-making issues of previous research works. Moreover, the two techniques utilized real-time traffic data, and collected vehicle and road users’ information using AI sensors and ITS-based devices. These data can be processed and transmitted using machine learning algorithms and cloud computing for traffic management, traffic decision-making policies, and documentation for future use. The proposed framework suggests that deploying such systems in smart cities’ transportation could play a significant role in predicting traffic outcomes, traffic forecasting, traffic decongestion, minimizing road users’ lost hours, suggesting alternative routes, and simplifying urban transportation activities for urban dwellers. Also, the proposed integrated framework adopted can address issues related to pollution in smart cities by promoting public transportation and advocating low-carbon emission zones. By implementing these solutions, smart cities can achieve sustainable traffic management and reduce their carbon footprint, making them livable and environmentally friendly. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, several new Artificial Intelligence methods have been developed to make models more explainable and interpretable. The techniques essentially deal with the implementation of transparency and traceability of black box machine learning methods. Black box refers to the inability to explain why the model turns the input into the output, which may be problematic in some fields. To overcome this problem, our approach provides a comprehensive combination of predictive and explainability techniques. Firstly, we compared statistical regression, classic machine learning and deep learning models, reaching the conclusion that models based on deep learning exhibit greater accuracy. Of the great variety of deep learning models, the best predictive model in spatio-temporal traffic datasets was found to be the Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network. Regarding the explainability technique, GraphMask shows a notably higher fidelity metric than other methods. The integration of both techniques was tested by means of experimental results, concluding that our approach improves deep learning model accuracy, making such models more transparent and interpretable. It allows us to discard up to 95% of the nodes used, facilitating an analysis of its behavior and thus improving the understanding of the model. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Featured Application: It can help citizens bypass congested roads and avoid rush hours by predicting future traffic flows in advance, thereby reducing their travel time and costs and increasing the operational capacity and efficiency of the road network. Accurate traffic flow forecasting is pivotal for intelligent traffic control and guidance. Manually capturing the intricate dependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions in traffic data presents a significant challenge. Prior methods have primarily employed Recurrent Neural Networks or Graph Convolutional Networks, without fully accounting for the interdependency between spatial and temporal factors. To address this, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism model (HSTAN). This model concurrently captures temporal correlations and spatial dependencies using a multi-headed self-attention mechanism in both temporal and spatial terms. It also integrates global spatial-temporal correlations through a hierarchical structure with residuals. Moreover, the analysis of attention weight matrices can depict complex spatial-temporal correlations, thereby enhancing our traffic forecasting capabilities. We conducted experiments on two publicly available traffic datasets, and the results demonstrated that the HSTAN model’s prediction accuracy surpassed that of several benchmark methods. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) have become an indispensable component of modern global technological development, as they play a massive role in the accurate statistical estimation of vehicles or individuals commuting to a particular transportation facility at a given time. This provides the perfect backdrop for designing and engineering an adequate infrastructural capacity for transportation analyses. However, traffic prediction remains a daunting task due to the non-Euclidean and complex distribution of road networks and the topological constraints of urbanized road networks. To solve this challenge, this paper presents a traffic forecasting model which combines a graph convolutional network, a gated recurrent unit, and a multi-head attention mechanism to simultaneously capture and incorporate the spatio-temporal dependence and dynamic variation in the topological sequence of traffic data effectively. By achieving 91.8% accuracy on the Los Angeles highway traffic (Los-loop) test data for 15-min traffic prediction and an R2 score of 85% on the Shenzhen City (SZ-taxi) test dataset for 15- and 30-min predictions, the proposed model demonstrated that it can learn the global spatial variation and the dynamic temporal sequence of traffic data over time. This has resulted in state-of-the-art traffic forecasting for the SZ-taxi and Los-loop datasets. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Spatio-temporal forecasting has several applications in neurology, climate, and transportation. One classic example of such a learning assignment is traffic forecasting. The task is complex because of traffic’s non-linearity and dynamic nature with shifting road conditions, complex geographic dependence, and the inherent challenges of long-term forecasting. We propose the Dynamic Temporal Position Observant Graph Neural Network (DTPO-GNN). DTPO-GNN considers positional awareness, spatial and temporal reliance on traffic flow for forecasting future traffic speeds. Specifically, DTPO-GNN employs positional awareness via reference nodes to collect global knowledge of graph structure and diffusion convolution employing random walks to gather local information about the structural properties of traffic networks. A controlled sample encoder-decoder architecture and two-way random walks across the graph are used to capture structural and temporal dependency. Combining three large-scale road network traffic statistics from the actual world, we observe a consistent improvement of 11-13 % above baselines from the most recent research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the case of missing data, traffic forecasting becomes challenging. Many existing studies on traffic flow forecasting with missing data often overlook the relationship between data imputation and external factors. To address this gap, this study proposes two hybrid models that incorporate multiple factors for predicting traffic flow in scenarios involving data loss. Temperature, rainfall intensity and whether it is a weekday will be introduced as multiple factors for data imputation and forecasting. Predictive mean matching (PMM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) can find the data that are most similar to the missing values as the interpolation value. In the forecasting module, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network can extract bidirectional time series features, which can improve forecasting accuracy. Therefore, PMM and KNN were combined with BiLSTM as P-BiLSTM and K-BiLSTM to forecast traffic flow, respectively. Experiments were conducted using a traffic flow dataset from the expressway S6 in Poland, considering various missing scenarios and missing rates. The experimental results showed that the proposed models outperform other traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the consideration of whether it is a working day further improves the predictive performance of the models. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In an urban environment, the accurate prediction of congestion levels is a prerequisite for formulating traffic demand management strategies reasonably. Current traffic forecasting studies mostly focus on the road topological network and assume that the spatial linkages of road segments is fixed, thus ignoring associated congestion level changes between road segments. This study introduces a fusion-based graph convolutional network called the F-GCN. The model aims to capture the dynamic correlations of the congestion levels among road segments while constructing the static topology of the road network. In particular, the entropy-based grey relation analysis method is first implemented in the dynamic graph convolutional network (GCN) module to measure the potential correlations among the observed congestion levels. Then, spatio-temporal blocks that integrate GCN layers, spatial attention mechanisms, and long short-term memory layers are built for both the static and dynamic GCN modules. Finally, the F-GCN model is developed by fusing the static GCN and dynamic GCN module. The numerical experiments on Beijing taxies demonstrated that the proposed F-GCN model achieved a significant 5.47%, 5.64%, and 8.14% improvements for the 15-, 30-, and 45-min prediction tasks in the weighted mean absolute percentage error compared to the state-of-the-art baseline models. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of the model in predicting congestion levels, demonstrating its superiority and potential in capturing the dynamic potential correlations among the congestion levels of road segments.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic flow/volume data are commonly used to calibrate and validate traffic simulation models. However, these data are generally obtained from stationary sensors (e.g. loop detectors), which are expensive to install and maintain and cover a small number of locations in the transport network. On the other hand, Floating Car Data (FCD) are readily available at the network level, usually from a sample of vehicles. We present an indirect traffic flow estimation approach using transfer learning to address the traffic flow data scarcity and model generalization across cities. Using two cities (Paris and Madrid) as study areas, we demonstrate the indirect estimation using only exogenous features for flow prediction, mirroring limited predictive features without past link flows. Subsequently, we use the model pre-trained on data from Paris city and test on data from Madrid city, and investigate the scenarios for successful transfer learning. Overall, the training set must adequately capture the flow-speed relationship for successful indirect flow estimation. Transfer learning is beneficial when the data for the target task is minimal, in which case transferred models outperform newly trained models from scratch. Using real-world and publicly available data, our approach and models can help scale a smaller traffic flow dataset to a larger sample across cities. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Traffic speed prediction is a crucial task of the intelligent traffic system. However, due to the highly nonlinear temporal patterns and non-static spatial dependence of traffic data, timely and accurate traffic forecasting remains a challenge. The existing methods usually use a static adjacency matrix to model spatial dependence while ignoring the spatial dynamic characteristics of the road network.Meanwhile, the dynamic influence of different time steps on the prediction target is ignored. Thus, we propose a dynamic multi-graph convolution recurrent neural network (DMGCRNN), which models the dynamic correlations of road networks over time based on various information of road network. Dynamic correlation is an essential factor for accurate traffic prediction, because it reflects the change of the traffic conditions in real-time. In this model, we design a dynamic graph construction method, which utilizes the local temporal and spatial characteristics of each road segment to construct dynamic graphs. Then, a dynamic multi-graph convolution fusion module is proposed, which considers the dynamic characteristics of spatial correlations and global information to model the dynamic trend of spatial dependence. Moreover, by combing the global context information, temporal attention is provided to capture the dynamic temporal dependence among different time steps. The experimental results from two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is an indispensable part of intelligent transportation systems. However, existing methods suffer from limited capability in capturing hierarchical temporal characteristics of the traffic time series. To be specific, they neglect the property that the time series is composed of trend-cyclical and seasonal parts. On the other hand, prior methods ignore the natural hierarchical structure of traffic road networks and thus fail to capture the macro spatial dependence of region networks. To address these issues, we propose a novel spatio-temporal hierarchical MLP network (STHMLP) for traffic forecasting. By adopting a decomposition architecture in the STHMLP, trend-cyclical and seasonal features are gradually grasped from multi-scale local compositions of traffic time series. For each scale of traffic time series, we design a fine module and a coarse module to extract spatio-temporal information from roads and regions, respectively. Specifically, the fine module utilizes spatial filters on the frequency domain features of traffic time series to efficiently capture fine-grained spatial dependencies. The coarse module adaptively coarsens road networks to region networks and captures coarse-grained spatial dependencies from region networks. Experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate the STHMLP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on traffic forecasting. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In the modern world, road traffic signs are vital for drivers safety. In fact, multistep traffic forecasting on road networks can help to avoid many problems on the streets. In this context, there are several methods which allow to achieve excellent results in the field of traffic signs recognition. Recently, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have achieved excellent results in this area. In this paper, CNN is used to develop a Traffic and Road Sign recognition system. The performance of the proposed architecture is measured using a novel dataset, namely the Tunisian traffic signs dataset. In addition, we minimize the number of layers in the LeNet network, lowering the number of parameters in the network to accelerate the computation. Our architecture was used with varying parameters in order to achieve the best recognition rates in uncontrolled environment including weather conditions, complex background, variable illumination, and sign color fading. The Experimental results show that the proposed CNN architecture achieved a significant accuracy, thus higher than those achieved in similar previous studies. © 2023

AB  - Traffic forecasting models rely on data that needs to be sensed, processed, and stored. This requires the deployment and maintenance of traffic sensing infrastructure, often leading to unaffordable monetary costs. The lack of sensed locations can be complemented with synthetic data simulations that further lower the economical investment needed for traffic monitoring. One of the most common data generative approaches consists of producing real-like traffic patterns, according to data distributions from analogous roads. The process of detecting roads with similar traffic is the key point of these systems. However, without collecting data at the target location no flow metrics can be employed for this similarity-based search. We present a method to discover locations among those with available traffic data by inspecting topological features. These features are extracted from domain-specific knowledge as numerical representations (embeddings) to compare different locations and eventually find roads with analogous daily traffic profiles based on the similarity between embeddings. The performance of this novel selection system is examined and compared to simpler traffic estimation approaches. After finding a similar source of data, a generative method is used to synthesize traffic profiles. Depending on the resemblance of the traffic behavior at the sensed road, the generation method can be fed with data from one road only. Several generation approaches are analyzed in terms of the precision of the synthesized samples. Above all, this work intends to stimulate further research efforts towards enhancing the quality of synthetic traffic samples and thereby, reducing the need for sensing infrastructure.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is significant for establishing intelligent traffic systems. However, the complex spatial-temporal relationships of traffic flow data make it challenging. Despite some studies investigating this problem, capturing complex spatial structures and learning the temporal dependence of the long-term prediction are still challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based spatial-temporal graph transformer (ASTGT) model to solve the traffic flow forecasting problem. ASTGT primarily consists of two independent components: temporal encoder and spatial-temporal decoder. Precisely, in temporal encoder, we capture the temporal dynamics of traffic data through the self-attention mechanism. The traffic flow data with long-term periodic dependence are also integrated. Moreover, spatial-temporal decoder superimposes the gated spatial graph convolution block to acquire both temporal and spatial relationships at the same time. Extensive experiments are conducted on PEMS04 and PEMS08 datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System. The results show that our proposed ASTGT model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Precise forecasts of railway container demand is crucial for railway infrastructure construction and daily operations management. Nevertheless, temporal variations in railway container traffic are subject to a diversity of factors, and such dynamics are therefore extremely difficult to capture in forecasts. Decomposing the temporal data into a number of subseries with distinct qualities is a prevalent technique for reducing the complexity of data. Yet, a few of sub-series resulted from such decomposition tend to remain irregular and unstable. In this study, a novel secondary decomposition–ensemble method is proposed for railroad container volume forecasting. Specifically, CEEDMAN and VMD are employed successively to decompose the time series into various components. The sub-series are processed by different models, according to their distinct features, to yield their respective independent predictions, which are then ensembled to give the final railway container traffic forecast. Additionally, we incorporate the DEEPAR model for interval predictions, providing valuable uncertainty information that assists decision-makers in preparing for potential challenges. Our method demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to other benchmark models, even in the presence of disruptive events such as the big epidemic. We further validate the applicability and robustness of the proposed method by incorporating an additional dataset with a finer-time data. Our findings contribute to the field of railway container demand forecasting and offer practical insights for decision-makers in the railway industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Significant efforts have been made for vehicle-to-vehicle communications that now enable the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, current IoV solutions are unable to capture traffic data both accurately and securely. Another drawback of current IoV models that are based on deep learning is that the methods used do not tune hyperparameters efficiently. In this paper, a new system known as Secure and Intelligent System for the Internet of Vehicles (SISIV) is developed. A deep learning architecture based on graph convolutional networks and an attention mechanism are implemented. In addition, blockchain technology is used to protect data transmission between nodes in the IoV system. Moreover, the hyperparameters of the generated deep learning model are intelligently selected using a branch-and-bound technique. To validate SISIV, experiments were conducted on four networked vehicle databases dealing with prediction problems. In terms of forecasting rate ( > 90%), F-measure ( > 80%), and attack detection (< 75%), the results clearly show the superiority of SISIV over baseline systems. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art solutions based on traffic prediction, SISIV enables efficient and reliable prediction of traffic flow in an IoV context. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Federated Learning (FL), a crucial advancement in smart city technology, combines real-time traffic predictions with the potential to enhance urban mobility. This paper suggests a novel approach to real-time traffic prediction in smart cities: a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) architecture. The investigation started with the systematic collection and preprocessing of a low-resolution dataset (1.6 GB) derived from real-time Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) traffic camera images at significant intersections in Guntur and Vijayawada. The dataset has been cleaned up utilizing min-max normalization to facilitate use. The primary contribution of this study is the hybrid architecture that it develops by fusing RNN to detect temporal dynamics with CNN for geographic extraction of characteristics. While the RNN's recurrent interactions preserve hidden states for sequential processing, the CNN efficiently retrieves high-level spatial information from static traffic images. Weight adjustments and backpropagation are used in the training of the proposed hybrid model in order to enhance real-time predictions that aid in traffic management. Notably, the implementation is done with Python software. The model reaches a testing accuracy of 99.8% by the 100th epoch, demonstrating excellent performance in the results and discussion section. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) results, which show a 4.5% improvement over existing methods like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Sparse Auto Encoder (SAE), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), illustrate the efficacy of the model. This demonstrates how well complex patterns may be represented by the model, yielding precise real-time traffic predictions in crowded metropolitan settings. A new era of more precise and effective real-time traffic forecasts is about to begin, thanks to the hybrid CNN-RNN architecture, which is validated by the combined strengths of FL, CNN, and RNN as well as the overall outcomes. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - Next-generation mobile networks are expected to meet the requirements of a wide range of new vertical services. Hence, the network slicing concept has been introduced, in which Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) are allowed to provide various types of services over the same physical infrastructure, owned by an Infrastructure Provider (InP). To cope with an ever-changing traffic demand, MVNOs seek to pre-allocate/reconfigure the resources at the base stations in an anticipatory manner, based on traffic demand predictions. Ideally, conducting per-slice traffic forecasting requires information that is likely to disclose MVNO confidential information (i.e., business strategy or private user data). To secure data ownership while conducting traffic forecasting, we propose the Federated Proximal Long Short-Term Memory (FPLSTM) framework, which allows MVNOs to train their local models with their private dataset at each base station; subsequently, an associated InP global model can be updated through the aggregation of the local models. The results obtained by training the models on a real-world dataset indicate that the forecasting performance of our proposed approach is as accurate as state-of-the-art centralized solutions, while improving data privacy. To enable scalability, we further propose the Information-based Clustering FPLSTM (IC-FPLSTM) and Random Clustering FPLSTM (RC-FPLSTM) frameworks, dealing with large-scale cellular networks. These solutions demonstrate computation and communication cost efficiency significantly above the state-of-the-art.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - To meet the ever-increasing traffic demand and enhance the coverage of cellular networks, network densification is one of the crucial paradigms of 5G and beyond mobile networks, which can improve system capacity by deploying a large number of Access Points (APs) in the service area. However, since the energy consumption of APs generally accounts for a substantial part of the communication system, how to deal with the consequent energy issue is a challenging task for a mobile network with densely deployed APs. In this paper, we propose an intelligent AP switching on/off scheme to reduce the system energy consumption with the prerequisite of guaranteeing the quality of service, where the signaling overhead is also taken into consideration to ensure the stability of the network. First, based on historical traffic data, a long short-term memory method is introduced to predict the future traffic distribution, by which we can roughly determine when the AP switching operation should be triggered; second, we present an efficient three-step AP selection strategy to determine which of the APs would be switched on or off; third, an AP switching scheme with a threshold is proposed to adjust the switching frequency so as to improve the stability of the system. Experiment results indicate that our proposed traffic forecasting method performs well in practical scenarios, where the normalized root mean square error is within 10%. Furthermore, the achieved energy-saving is more than 28% on average with a reasonable outage probability and switching frequency for an area served by 40 APs in a commercial mobile network. © 2023 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications

AB  - The forecast of network traffic with arbitrary predicting horizon is a key enabler of smart management in next-generation networks, as sufficient amount of time can be provided for the proactive manipulation of network resources to maintain high quality transmission. Nevertheless, the evolving characteristic of network traffic challenges the current learning-based and data-driven algorithms on both prediction accuracy and computational complexity. In this work, we explore special properties of network traffic, which are further encoded into the Gaussian Process (GP)-based online learning framework, so as to better comprehend and predict future network traffic from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, we proceed by three steps, 1). Observing network traffic is evolving, to explore and exploit the dynamic traffic patterns at different times and time-scales, we try to approximate the optimal kernel function of GP by utilizing a mixture of Gaussian to encode the dominant and several nondominant patterns. 2). As network traffic at different time-scales share several common patterns, we adopt Process Convolution (PConv) to fully exploit correlations among multiple subsequent time-slots, so as to facilitate network traffic forecast with large predicting horizon. 3). To promote the tracking capability of the proposed GP-PConv framework without significantly increasing the number of hyper-parameters to train, we slightly modify the GP-based prediction through Lyapunov optimization, which brings performance improvements both in terms of accuracy and computational complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm through simulation.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting has been an important area of research for several decades, with significant implications for urban traffic planning, management, and control. In recent years, deep-learning models, such as graph neural networks (GNN), have shown great promise in traffic forecasting due to their ability to capture complex spatio–temporal dependencies within traffic networks. Additionally, public authorities around the world have started providing real-time traffic data as open-government data (OGD). This large volume of dynamic and high-value data can open new avenues for creating innovative algorithms, services, and applications. In this paper, we investigate the use of traffic OGD with advanced deep-learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy two GNN models—the Temporal Graph Convolutional Network and Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network—to predict traffic flow based on real-time traffic OGD. Our evaluation of the forecasting models shows that both GNN models outperform the two baseline models—Historical Average and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average—in terms of prediction performance. We anticipate that the exploitation of OGD in deep-learning scenarios will contribute to the development of more robust and reliable traffic-forecasting algorithms, as well as provide innovative and efficient public services for citizens and businesses. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Urban traffic forecasting is the cornerstone of the intelligent transportation system (ITS). Existing methods focus on spatial-temporal dependency modeling, while two intrinsic properties of the traffic forecasting problem are overlooked. First, the complexity of diverse forecasting tasks is nonuniformly distributed across various spaces (e.g., suburb versus downtown) and times (e.g., rush hour versus off-peak). Second, the recollection of past traffic conditions is beneficial to the prediction of future traffic conditions. Based on these properties, we propose a bidirectional spatial-temporal adaptive transformer (Bi-STAT) for accurate traffic forecasting. Bi-STAT adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, where both the encoder and the decoder maintain a spatial-adaptive transformer and a temporal-adaptive transformer structure. Inspired by the first property, each transformer is designed to dynamically process the traffic streams according to their task complexities. Specifically, we realize this by the recurrent mechanism with a novel dynamic halting module (DHM). Each transformer performs iterative computation with shared parameters until DHM emits a stopping signal. Motivated by the second property, Bi-STAT utilizes one decoder to perform the present → past recollection task and the other decoder to perform the present → future prediction task. The recollection task supplies complementary information to assist and regularize the prediction task for a better generalization. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of each module in Bi-STAT and demonstrate the superiority of Bi-STAT over the state-of-the-art baselines on four benchmark datasets.

AB  - With the rapid development of the 5G communications, the edge intelligence enables Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to provide traffic forecasting to alleviate traffic congestion and improve quality of experience of users simultaneously. To enhance the forecasting performance, a novel edge-enabled probabilistic graph structure learning model (PGSLM) is proposed, which learns the graph structure and parameters by the edge sensing information and discrete probability distribution on the edges of the traffic road network. To obtain the spatio-temporal dependencies of traffic data, the learned dynamic graphs are combined with a predefined static graph to generate the graph convolution part of the recurrent graph convolution module. During the training process, a new graph training loss is introduced, which is composed of the K nearest neighbor (KNN) graph constructed by the traffic feature tensors and the graph structure. Detailed experimental results show that, compared with existing models, the proposed PGSLM improves the traffic prediction performance in terms of average absolute error and root mean square error in IoV. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.

AB  - Forecasting accurate traffic conditions is essential to regional traffic management. Since congestions are usually caused by regular activities, capturing speed-cycle patterns for congestions is useful for short-term traffic forecasting. In this study, we propose a novel approach, namely Neighbor Subset Deep Neutral Network (NSDNN), to forecast spatio-temporal data; the approach conjoins Deep Neutral Network (DNN) and the subset selection method, in order to extract useful inputs from nearby roads. Appropriate input subsets can be selected for DNN training via congestion cycle patterns, in order to reduce input data dimensions and to avoid artificial high correlations from free-flow traffic in off-peak hours. Furthermore, speed data with time lag is also embedded into the DNN model to generate the multi-timestep forecast model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NSDNN achieves higher accuracy, compared to other conventional methods including the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), the correlation method and the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). In addition, NSDNN is also comparable to the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network, namely NSLSTM, when the same selected input subset is used. The forecasting system can be used by logistic companies to produce better route planning and fleet management in assigning vehicles. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic prediction is of vital importance in intelligent transportation systems. It enables efficient route planning, congestion avoidance, and reduction of travel time, etc. However, accurate road traffic prediction is challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies within the traffic network. Establishing and learning spatial dependencies are pivotal for accurate traffic prediction. Unfortunately, many existing methods for capturing spatial dependencies consider only single relationships, disregarding potential temporal and spatial correlations within the traffic network. Moreover, the end-to-end training methods often lack control over the training direction during graph learning. Additionally, existing traffic forecasting methods often fail to integrate multiple traffic data sources effectively, which affects prediction accuracy adversely. In order to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of the traffic network accurately, a novel traffic prediction framework, Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network based on Multi-graph Fusion (DTS-AdapSTNet), is proposed. Firstly, in order to better extract the hidden spatial dependencies, a method for fusing multiple factors is designed, which includes the distance relationship, transfer relationship and same-road segment relationship of traffic data. Secondly, an adaptive learning method is proposed, which can control the learning direction of parameters better by the adaptive matrix generation module and traffic prediction module. Thirdly, an improved loss function is designed for training processes and a multi-matrix fusion module is designed to perform weighted fusion of the learned matrices, updating the spatial adjacency matrix continuously, which fuses as much traffic information as possible for more accurate traffic prediction. Finally, experimental results using two large real-world datasets demonstrate that the DTS-AdapSTNet model outperforms other baseline models in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) when forecasting traffic speed one hour ahead. On average, it achieves reductions of 12.4%, 9.8% and 16.1%, respectively. Moreover, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of the individual modules of DTS-AdapSTNet. © 2024 Shi et al.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a particularly challenging and important application direction in the field of spatial–temporal prediction. However, it is difficult for existing models to accurately capture the long time dependence of traffic data and the complex spatial dependence of road network. To solve these two issues, in this work, we propose a new deep learning framework — Memory Augmented Graph Convolutional Network (MA-GCN), which combines graph convolutional network (GCN) with differential neural computer (DNC). In the model, GCN is used to learn the complex road network structure to capture the spatial dependence, while DNC is applied to learn the long-term dynamic changes of traffic data to capture the long time dependence. Based on this, the traffic prediction is implemented, and the experimental evaluation is carried out on two public datasets, PeMSD4 and PeMSD8. The results show that the MA-GCN model is superior to the comparative models on several evaluation metrics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Providing connectivity to high-density traffic demand is one of the key promises of future wireless networks. The open radio access network (O-RAN) is one of the critical drivers ensuring such connectivity in heterogeneous networks. Despite intense interest from researchers in this domain, key challenges remain to ensure efficient network resource allocation and utilization. This paper proposes a dynamic traffic forecasting scheme to predict future traffic demand in federated O-RAN. Utilizing information on user demand and network capacity, we propose a fully reconfigurable admission control framework via fuzzy-logic optimization. We also perform detailed analysis on several parameters (user satisfaction level, utilization gain, and fairness) over benchmarks from various papers. The results show that the proposed forecasting and fuzzy-logic-based admission control framework significantly enhances fairness and provides guaranteed quality of experience without sacrificing resource utilization. Moreover, we have proven that the proposed framework can accommodate a large number of devices connected simultaneously in the federated O-RAN. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is the foundation of urban traffic guidance and control, as well as the main function of an intelligent transportation system (ITS). Accurate traffic flow prediction is important for road users, traffic management departments, and private enterprises. However, traffic flows usually show a high degree of variability, correlation, and complex patterns in both temporal and spatial domain, which makes accurate traffic flow prediction a challenging task. How to capture the potential and dynamic spatial-temporal relationships of traffic data has been the bottleneck issue for intelligent transportation researchers. To solve the above problems, this article proposes an adaptive graph fusion convolutional recurrent network (AGFCRN) to model the temporal and spatial characteristics of traffic flow data dynamically and adaptively. An adaptive graph fusion convolution is proposed to discover the changing relationships between traffic volumes without a priori knowledge. It uses a self-learned node embedding to generate static graphs and combines current and historical states to generate dynamic graphs at each time step. A gated recurrent layer with residual structure is designed to mitigate the decay of prediction effects in long-term modeling. In addition, an attention layer incorporating self-learned node embedding is introduced in the AGFCRN to efficiently adjust the prediction pattern of each node. Experiments on several public data sets demonstrate that AGFCRN can achieve competitive performance compared to other typical and state-of-the-art methods. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting on a large-scale sensor network is of great practical significance for policy decision-making, urban management, and transport planning. Recently, several prediction methods based on graph convolution have been put forward. However, they are limited to small-scale analyses because of high computation complexity and fail to integrate spatial-temporal dependencies sufficiently between sensors with a large topological distance in multiple time steps. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep framework called PFNet to perform large-scale traffic forecasting. PFNet captures temporal correlations using deep multi-view sequence encoders (DMVSE) and spatial correlations using graph embedding technologies on transportation networks. Spatial-temporal dependencies are more comprehensively fused using cascaded progressive attention (CPA) modules due to the full use of latent temporal and spatial representation. Experiments are conducted on two large-scale traffic datasets (LondonHW and ManchesterHW) from England Highway. The results demonstrate that PFNet outperforms several existing state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate spatiotemporal traffic flow forecasting is significant for the modern traffic management and control. In order to capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of the traffic flow simultaneously, we propose a novel spatiotemporal residual graph attention network (STRGAT). First, the network adopts a deep full residual graph attention block, which performs a dynamic aggregation of spatial features regarding the node information of the traffic network. Second, a sequence-to-sequence block is designed to capture the temporal dependence in the traffic flow. The traffic flow data with weekly periodic dependencies are also integrated and STRGAT is used for traffic forecasting of traffic road networks. The experiments are conducted on three real data sets in California, USA. Results verify that our proposed STRGAT is able to learn the spatiotemporal correlation of traffic flow well and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting which has attracted wide attention is the critical issue of the intelligent transportation systems. However, despite its prominent achievements, there are still some challenges due to the complexity of spatial and temporal correlations, which exist in plenty of traffic data. In this paper, a dynamic Jacobi graph and trend-aware flow attention convolutional network (JGFACN) is proposed for traffic forecasting. More specially, a dynamic Jacobi graph convolution network with self-attention is developed for acquiring the spatial correlations among different traffic sensors, in which dynamic adjacency matrix can be derived from the data by dynamic adjacency matrix generator and the spatial correlation among traffic sensors can be minded by Jacobi graph convolution network and self-attention. Secondly, a temporal trend-aware multi-head flow attention mechanism following with a causal dilated convolution is introduced for leveraging the temporal correlation of traffic data effectively. With the help of trend-aware multi-head flow attention, the nonlinear and long-term traffic data can be handled effectively via considering comprehensive information from different representation subspaces and reducing the quadratic complexity. Meanwhile, the participation of a causal dilated convolution can exponentially expand the receptive field. Thirdly, because the nearby spatial-temporal observations are often more correlated, the spatial-temporal order information of traffic data plays an important role in traffic forecasting. Consequently, the rotary temporal position embedding (RTPE) and the learnable spatial positional embedding (LSPE) with graph convolution network are equipped for acquiring the spatial-temporal positional information effectively. Meanwhile, the LSPE with graph convolution network can solve the problem of spatial heterogeneity. At last, the results of extensive experiments on vast amounts of traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed JGFACN. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively used in a wide variety of domains in recent years. Owing to their power in analyzing graph-structured data, they have become broadly popular in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications as well. Despite their widespread applications in different transportation domains, there is no comprehensive review of recent advancements and future research directions that covers all transportation areas. Accordingly, in this survey, for the first time, we provide an overview of GNN studies in the general domain of ITS. Unlike previous surveys, which have been limited to traffic forecasting problems, we explore how GNN frameworks have evolved for different ITS applications, including traffic forecasting, demand prediction, autonomous vehicles, intersection management, parking management, urban planning, and transportation safety. Also, we micro-categorize the studies based on their transportation application to identify domain-specific research directions, opportunities, and challenges, which have been missing in previous surveys. Moreover, we identify unique and undiscussed research opportunities and directions, which is the result of reviewing a wide range of transportation applications. The neglected role of edge and graph learning in ITS applications, developing multi-modal models, and exploiting the power of unsupervised and reinforcement learning methods for developing more powerful GNNs are some examples of such new discussions in this survey. Finally, we have identified popular baseline models and datasets in each transportation domain, which facilitate the development and evaluation of future GNN-based frameworks.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance on the path of enabling 5G mobile networks to perform intelligent and efficient infrastructure planning and management. However, available data are limited to base station logging information. Hence, training methods for generating high-quality predictions that can generalize to new observations across diverse parties are in demand. Traditional approaches require collecting measurements from multiple base stations, transmitting them to a central entity and conducting machine learning operations using the acquire data. The dissemination of local observations raises concerns regarding confidentiality and performance, which impede the applicability of machine learning techniques. Although various distributed learning methods have been proposed to address this issue, their application to traffic prediction remains highly unexplored. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of federated learning applied to raw base station LTE data for time-series forecasting. We evaluate one-step predictions using five different neural network architectures trained with a federated setting on non-identically distributed data. Our results show that the learning architectures adapted to the federated setting yield equivalent prediction error to the centralized setting. In addition, preprocessing techniques on base stations enhance forecasting accuracy, while advanced federated aggregators do not surpass simpler approaches. Simulations considering the environmental impact suggest that federated learning holds the potential for reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption. Finally, we consider a large-scale scenario with synthetic data and demonstrate that federated learning reduces the computational and communication costs compared to centralized settings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intelligent traffic monitoring is a prominent topic of investigation due the emergence of advancements like the Internet interconnected Things and intelligent computers. Combining these technologies will make it easier to methods to aid in making better choices and accelerating urban growth. Intelligent sensing has come to the forefront in recent years due to its capacity to make calculated decisions on its own to address difficult issues. Automatic vehicles and smart gadgets are equipped with sensors that are part of an IoT-based system in order to recognize, gather, and transmit data. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques allow machines to acquire knowledge and keep tabs on their surroundings through continuous sensing. Improvements in variable traffic control strategies for overcrowded cities have numerous positive outcomes, one of which is increased road safety. Since the sensors on which conventional dynamic controllers relied had their own shortcomings, we might use vision sensors (like cameras) to avoid these issues. Image and video-based computing has a lot of potential for measuring traffic volumes. A new traffic management system named Enhanced Transportation Technologies (ETT) is implemented to relieve congestion at the busy intersection after the old one was deemed to be inadequate. The term "intelligent transportation system" (ITS) refers to a group of transportation systems to keep drivers and passengers safe on the road and to facilitate autonomous mobility by optimizing control systems. To further improve urban planning, crowd behavior, and traffic forecasting, dependable AI models have been developed to work in tandem with ITS. Compared to controllers using conventional sensors, the proposed model has been shown through extensive simulations to reduce waiting time and increase movement speed on average. ©2024 The Authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is crucial for location-based services. Recent studies tend to utilize dynamic graph neural networks to capture spatial-temporal correlations. However, urban traffic faces spatial heterogeneity of different lane structure at intersections, leading to different traffic patterns of lanes in different directions. It also confronts temporal heterogeneity of varying traffic trends in different time periods. Unfortunately, the influence of such spatial-temporal heterogeneity on traffic evolution are not fully considered in existing methods. To this end, this paper proposes a novel dynamic-graph-based model called HA-STGN, which integrates these heterogeneous features into spatial-learning components to model traffic networks in a finer granularity. Specifically, we design a dynamic graph model, which performs on a direction-aware road network to extract the structural information of intersections. Then, a time-sensitive attention mechanism is proposed to perceive the effect of time by introducing explicit temporal features. Moreover, an adaptive fusion module is provided to balance the spatial-temporal information adaptively. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our model. The results show that our proposed HA-STGN can effectively capture spatial-temporal dependencies and outperform all the baseline methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is essential in improving and maintaining safety and orderliness in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). As a deep learning approach, graph neural networks (GNN) based spatial-temporal association mining methods are promising in traffic forecasting. However, current GNN-based methods usually require a high number of training data, and when the sample volume is small, the performance of the model drops dramatically. The existing transfer methods can solve this problem by leveraging knowledge from other data-rich areas, but the domain adaption method with access to source data still faces the non-neglectable problem of private information leakage in the source area. A solution that can solve cross-area transfer without access to source data is still missing. In this paper, to fill the gap, we propose a Transferable Federated Inductive Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (T-ISTGNN) framework to transfer spatial-temporal dependency information in cross-area data to accomplish traffic state forecasting. First, we introduce a multi-source model aggregation scheme based on federated learning to retain the traffic information of the source areas. Second, we propose a transfer method between source and target areas based on hypothesis transfer learning to achieve domain adaption under source domain data protection. Third, we propose a GNN-based method called Inductive Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ISTGNN) for traffic forecasting. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that T-ISTGNN is capable of cross-area traffic state forecasting under the restriction of preserving the privacy of source areas.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for the advancement of smart cities. Although there have been many studies on traffic forecasting, the accurate forecasting of traffic volume is still a challenge. To effectively capture the spatio-temporal correlations of traffic data, a deep learning-based traffic volume forecasting model called the Enhanced Information Graph Recursive Network (EIGRN) is presented in this paper. The model consists of three main parts: a Graph Embedding Adaptive Graph Convolution Network (GE-AGCN), a Modified Gated Recursive Unit (MGRU), and a local information enhancement module. The local information enhancement module is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a transposed convolutional neural network, and an attention mechanism. In the EIGRN, the GE-AGCN is used to capture the spatial correlation of the traffic network by adaptively learning the hidden information of the complex topology, the MGRU is employed to capture the temporal correlation by learning the time change of the traffic volume, and the local information enhancement module is employed to capture the global and local correlations of the traffic volume. The EIGRN was evaluated using the real datasets PEMS-BAY and PeMSD7(M) to assess its predictive performance The results indicate that the forecasting performance of the EIGRN is better than the comparison models. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate traffic prediction is vital for traffic management, control, and urbanization construction. Extensive research efforts have diligently focused on capturing the intricate spatio-temporal relationships that are inherent in traffic data. However, a limited number of studies have fully exploited the potential of periodicity, a distinctive and valuable characteristic of transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel GRU- and Transformer-Based Periodicity Fusion Network (GTPFN) to distinguish the effects of different types of periodic data and integrate them seamlessly and effectively. Initially, the proposed model captures dynamic spatio-temporal correlations and obtains the candidate prediction result by employing a GRU encoder–decoder with spatial attention, focusing on the hourly data. Subsequently, we design the Pattern Induction Block based on GRU layers to extract regular traffic patterns from daily and weekly data. Finally, the Pattern Fusion Transformer integrates these patterns, followed by a Feedforward layer, to yield the final prediction output. Experiments on the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PEMS) datasets illustrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art baseline models on most predicted horizons. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have recently gained popularity in the forecasting domain due to their ability to model complex spatial and temporal patterns in tasks such as traffic forecasting and region-based demand forecasting. Most of these methods require a predefined graph as input, whereas in real-life multivariate time series problems, a well-predefined dependency graph rarely exists. This requirement makes it harder for GNNs to be utilised widely for multivariate forecasting problems in other domains such as retail or energy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach combining neural networks and statistical structure learning models to self-learn the dependencies and construct a dynamically changing dependency graph from multivariate data aiming to enable the use of GNNs for multivariate forecasting even when a well-defined graph does not exist. The statistical structure modeling in conjunction with neural networks provides a well-principled and efficient approach by bringing in causal semantics to determine dependencies among the series. Finally, we demonstrate significantly improved performance using our proposed approach on real-world benchmark datasets without a pre-defined dependency graph. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To explore the relevance between bus stops and make the real-time prediction of bus passenger flow more accurate, this paper proposes a Traffic Forecast Model based on the Attention mechanism (TFMA). The model combines data preprocessing with bus stops’ information coding to predict short-term bus passenger flow based on the real-time relevance of the bus stops. First of all, the paper conducts a statistical analysis of the actual public transportation card data of Suzhou, China, and obtains the characteristics of real-time relevance of different bus stops. Secondly, bus route and bus stop information, the passenger flow rate of change, weather, date, and other related factors are integrated into the coding information of the bus stops. Then the method relies on the Attention mechanism to calculate the real-time relevance of the bus stops parallelly; the core algorithm also uses a multi-headed mechanism to increase the connection of the channel and the residual error, further improving the prediction ability. Finally, this article uses actual data from Suzhou's public transport for verification. The results show that: In terms of accuracy, TFMA outperforms multiple linear regression, GRU, and LightGBM, reaching a very high accuracy of nearly 90%. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In the era of 5G and beyond, the increasing complexity of wireless networks necessitates innovative frameworks for efficient management and deployment. Digital twins (DTs), embodying real-time monitoring, predictive configurations, and enhanced decision-making capabilities, stand out as a promising solution in this context. Within a time-series data-driven framework that effectively maps wireless networks into digital counterparts, encapsulated by integrated vertical and horizontal twinning phases, this study investigates the security challenges in distributed network DT (NDT) systems, which potentially undermine the reliability of subsequent network applications, such as wireless traffic forecasting. Specifically, we consider a minimal-knowledge scenario for all attackers, in that they do not have access to network data and other specialized knowledge, yet can interact with previous iterations of server-level models. In this context, we spotlight a novel fake traffic injection attack designed to compromise a distributed NDT system for wireless traffic prediction. In response, we then propose a defense mechanism, termed global-local inconsistency detection (GLID), to counteract various model poisoning threats. GLID strategically removes abnormal model parameters that deviate beyond a particular percentile range, thereby fortifying the security of network twinning process. Through extensive experiments on real-world wireless traffic data sets, our experimental evaluations show that both our attack and defense strategies significantly outperform existing baselines, highlighting the importance of security measures in the design and implementation of DTs for 5G and beyond network systems. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate spatial-temporal prediction is a fundamental building block of many real-world applications such as traffic scheduling and management, environment policy making, and public safety. This problem is still challenging due to nonlinear, complicated, and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel embedded spatial-temporal network (ESTNet), which extracts efficient features to model the dynamic correlations and then exploits three-dimension convolution to synchronously model the spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we propose multi-range graph convolution networks for extracting multi-scale static features from the fine-grained road network. Meanwhile, dynamic features are extracted from real-time traffic using a gated recurrent unit network. These features can be applied to identify the dynamic and flexible correlations among sensors and make it possible to exploit a three-dimension convolution unit (3DCon) to simultaneously model the spatial-temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose a residual network by stacking multiple 3DCon to capture the nonlinear and complicated dependencies. The effectiveness and superiority of ESTNet are verified on two real-world datasets, and experiments show ESTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art with a significant margin. The code and models will be publicly available.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS), the vital technology of ITS, short-term traffic forecasting, gains increasing attention. However, the existing prediction models ignore the impact of urban functional zones (FZs) on traffic data, resulting in inaccurate extractions of dynamic spatial relationships from network. Furthermore, how to calculate the influence of external factors, such as weather and holidays on traffic is an unsolved problem. This article proposes a spatio-temporal hierarchical mapping and interactive attention network (HMIAN), which extracts the spatial features from traffic network by constructing FZs, and designs an effective external factors fusion method. HMIAN uses the hierarchical mapping structure to aggregate the roads into FZs, calculate the interaction between FZs and feed this information back to the spatial features. And the interactive attention mechanism is utilized to fuse the traffic data with external factors effectively, and extracts temporal features. In addition, some experiments were carried out on three real traffic data sets. First, experiment results show the better prediction performance of the proposed model compared with other existing methods in a complex traffic network. Second, the longitudinal comparison experiment verifies that the hierarchical mapping structure is effective in extracting spatial features in a complex road network. Finally, the influence of different external factors and fusion methods on traffic prediction are compared, which provides a consult for subsequent research on the influence of external factors.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is crucial to achieving a smart city as it facilitates public transportation management, autonomous driving, and the resource relocation of the sharing economy. Traffic forecasting belongs to the challenging spatiotemporal forecasting task, which is highly demanding because of the complicated geospatial correlation between traffic nodes, inconsistent and highly non-linear temporal patterns due to various events, and sporadic traffic accidents. Previous graph neural network (GNN) models built for transportation forecasting feature the sophisticated structure and heavy computation cost as they combine the deep neural network and graph machine learning to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics for the whole transportation network. However, it may be more practical for practitioners to perform node-wise forecasting for specific nodes of interest rather than network-wise forecasting. To mitigate the gaps mentioned above, we propose a novel graph ensemble deep random vector functional link network (GEdRVFL) to forecast the future traffic volume by combining the well-performing ensemble deep random vector functional link (EdRVFL) with the graph convolution layer for a specific node and realize the node-wise traffic forecasting. After a comprehensive comparison with the state-of-the-art models, our model beats the others in four out of five cases measured by mean absolute scaled error. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic forecasting has attracted widespread attention recently. In reality, traffic data usually contains missing values due to sensor or communication errors. The Spatio-temporal feature in traffic data brings more challenges for processing such missing values, for which the classic techniques (e.g., data imputations) are limited: (1) in temporal axis, the values can be randomly or consecutively missing; (2) in spatial axis, the missing values can happen on one single sensor or on multiple sensors simultaneously. Recent models powered by Graph Neural Networks achieved satisfying performance on traffic forecasting tasks. However, few of them are applicable to such a complex missing-value context. To this end, we propose GCN-M, a Graph Convolutional Network model with the ability to handle the complex missing values in the Spatio-temporal context. Particularly, we jointly model the missing value processing and traffic forecasting tasks, considering both local Spatio-temporal features and global historical patterns in an attention-based memory network. We propose as well a dynamic graph learning module based on the learned local-global features. The experimental results on real-life datasets show the reliability of our proposed method. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The rapid growth of mobile internet usage, particularly in LTE networks, poses challenges for mobile operators in maintaining quality of service (QoS) and optimizing network design planning. Accurate traffic volume forecasting is crucial for network planning and effective resource allocation. This study aims to propose an enhancement to the accuracy of the holt's winter multiplicative seasonal (HWMS) method by applying the rolling forecast technique to achieve better forecasting results. Using a public dataset of 56 cells, the evaluation based on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) reveals the following sequence of prediction errors: HWMS & rolling forecast (20.47%), HWMS only (30.06%), FbProphet (30.45%), and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (31.52%). The cells are categorized as "Good" (59%), "Reasonable" (39%), and "Poor" (2%). The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a significantly higher percentage of cells in the "Good" category, with a 45% difference compared to HWMS without rolling forecast, which only achieved 14%. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms ARIMA by 50% and FbProphet by 37% in the same category. Furthermore, when applied to real data from a telecommunications company in Indonesia, the proposed method identified 11 cells that require solutions out of a total of 100 cells. In comparison, the ARIMA method identified 3 cells, FbProphet identified 12 cells, and HWMS without Rolling Forecast identified 9 cells. Thus, the company can provide solutions for the identified 11 cells without the need for excessive investment while still maintaining revenue potential. © (2023), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

AB  - Traffic forecasting constitutes a task of great importance in intelligent transport systems. Owing to the non-Euclidean structure of traffic data, the complicated spatial correlations, and the dynamic temporal dependencies, it is challenging to predict traffic accurately. Despite the fact that few prior studies have considered the interconnections between multiple traffic nodes at the same timestep, the majority of studies fail to capture the dependencies among multiple nodes at different timesteps. Furthermore, most existing work generates shallow graphs based solely on the distance between traffic nodes, which limits their representation competence and declines their power in capturing complex correlations. In particular, inspired by the recent breakthroughs in the generative adversarial network (GAN) and the power of the graph convolution network (GCN) in handling non-Euclidean data, this paper puts forward an adversarial multi-graph convolutional neural network model, named TFGAN, to address the abovementioned problems. We integrate the unsupervised model elasticity with the supervision provided by supervised training to help the GAN generator model generates accurate traffic predictions. To improve the representation and model the implicit correlations effectively, multiple GCNs are constructed within the generator based on various perspectives, such as similarity, correlation, and spatial distance. Meanwhile, GRU and self-attention are applied after each graph to capture the dynamic temporal dependencies across nodes. The comprehensive experiments on three different traffic variables (traffic flow, speed, and travel time) using six real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TFGAN outperforms the related state-of-the-art models and achieves significant results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Accurately capturing the spatial correlations of traffic network significantly benefits short-term traffic forecasting. Some existing works represent spatial correlations in a simple one-dimensional space, but they cannot represent the real spatial correlations among sensors comprehensively. The other existing works represent the spatial correlations through grid-based method, but the local correlation of constructed spatial map is too superficial to extract deep spatial features effectively. Therefore, a novel deep learning model is proposed, which aims to represent the spatial correlations more effectively through a new correlation matrix structure. In the proposed model, the correlations among sensors are calculated from multiple perspectives to construct the speed, volume, and occupancy correlation matrices respectively. Then, considering that highly correlated sensors are close in the spatial dimension, an enhanced heuristic optimization algorithm is proposed to evolve these three correlation matrices into optimal ones by reorganizing the highly correlated sensors into each other's neighborhood. Finally, the three optimal correlation matrices are combined to form a three-dimensional multivariate correlation matrix characterized by locally high correlation, which is beneficial to exploit the deep spatial features of traffic network. The experiments show that the proposed model has better accuracy and stability than other commonly used baseline models.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Federated learning (FL) is widely adopted in traffic forecasting tasks involving large-scale IoT-enabled sensor data since its decentralization nature enables data providers' privacy to be preserved. When employing state-of-the-art deep learning-based traffic predictors in FL systems, the existing FL frameworks confront overlarge communication overhead when transmitting these models' parameter updates since the modeling depth and breadth renders them incorporating an enormous number of parameters. In this article, we propose a practical FL scheme, namely, Clustering-based hierarchical and Two-step-optimized FL (CTFed), to tackle this issue. The proposed scheme follows a divide et impera strategy that clusters the clients into multiple groups based on the similarity between their local models' parameters. We integrate the particle swarm optimization algorithm and devises a two-step approach for local model optimization. This scheme enables only one but representative local model update from each cluster to be uploaded to the central server, thus reduces the communication overhead of the model updates transmission in FL. CTFed is orthogonal to the gradient compression- or sparsification-based approaches so that they can orchestrate to optimize the communication overhead. Extensive case studies on three real-world data sets and three state-of-the-art models demonstrate the outstanding training efficiency, accurate prediction performance, and robustness to unstable network environments of the proposed scheme.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting aims to use historical information to predict future traffic values, to achieve the purpose of easing traffic pressure. However, most existing methods can not extract spatial-temporal features from historical data comprehensively and maintain high-accuracy forecasting in long-term forecasting continuously. In this paper, we design a adaptive graph cross strided convolution network (AGCSCN) for long-term traffic forecasting, which mainly includes two deep learning components: crossd stride convolution network (CSCN) for temporal features extraction and adaptive graph convolution network (AGCN) for spatial features extraction. CSCN component ensures that all the historical information can be perceived, and uses parallel cross convolution kernels to enhance long-term forecasting ability by reflecting the difference over forecasting horizons. AGCN component further learns the spatial correlation of period and trend segments respectively on the basis of global adaptive spatial features perception. The experimental results on four real-world traffic datasets show that the proposed AGCSCN model outperforms the state-of-art baselines and achieves optimal forecasting accuracy over all forecasting horizons. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic accidents on urban roads are a major cause of death despite the development of traffic safety measures. However, the prediction of casualties in urban road traffic accidents has not been deeply explored in previous research. Effective forecasting methods for the casualties of traffic accidents can improve the manner of traffic accident warnings, further avoiding unnecessary loss. This paper provides a practicable model for traffic forecast problems, in which ten variables, including time characteristics, weather factors, accident types, collision characteristics, and road environment conditions, were selected as independent factors. A mixed-support vector machine (SVM) with a genetic algorithm (GA), sparrow search algorithm (SSA), grey wolf optimizer algorithm (GWO) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) separately are proposed to predict the casualties of collisions. Grounded on 4285 valid urban road traffic collisions, the computing results show that the SSA-SVM performs effectively in the casualties forecast compared with the GWO-SVM, GA-SVM and PSO-SVM. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - According to data traffic forecast reported in Cisco (2018), the volume of data transported by Internet in 2021 will exceed the threshold of 3.0 ZB per year, generated by roughly 30 billions of devices. SATCOM's capability to bring Internet connectivity in parts of the world that until few years ago was impossible to reach (e.g., in the middle of the ocean), the use of satellite platforms for M2M services has become more and more widespread, with an unprecedented increase over the last five years (see Herrero and De Gaudenzi, 2012 and Scalise et al., 2013) and expected further diffusion in the near future. One of the most interesting applications, enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), that has attracted significant attention in the M2M field is the personal vocal assistant (PVA). It is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions given through voice instructions. The main contribution of this article is a performance analysis, both theoretical and simulated, of satellite networks for PVA services over cruise ships. Namely, a PVA must provide feedback to the user in a short amount of time to guarantee a high Quality of Experience (QoE) Zhang et al., 2013. For this analysis, we tested different satellite providers and we come to a conclusion regarding their feasibility as a reference network for the PVS employment on a cruise ship. Future studies will investigate the proposed scenario by broadening the performance analysis through actual measurements over a real-world satellite channel to practically demonstrate the validity of our approach.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The world is changing quite rapidly while increasingly tuning into digitalization. However, it is important to note that data science is what most technology is evolving around and data is definitely the future of everything. For industries, adopting a “data science approach” is no longer an option, it becomes an obligation in order to enhance their business rather than survive. This paper offers a roadmap for anyone interested in this research field or getting started with “machine learning” learning while enabling the reader to easily comprehend the key concepts behind. Indeed, it examines the benefits of automated machine learning systems, starting with defining machine learning vocabulary and basic concepts. Then, explaining how to, concretely, build up a machine learning model by highlighting the challenges related to data and algorithms. Finally, exposing a summary of two studies applying machine learning in two different fields, namely transportation for road traffic forecasting and supply chain management for demand prediction where the predictive performance of various models is compared based on different metrics. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - The continuous development of highway construction projects has prompted the function of service areas to be improved day by day. A traditional service area gradually transforms from a single traffic service mode to a complex traffic service mode. The continuous enrichment and perfection of the service area’s function makes the surrounding highway network more attractive, which leads to a sudden increase in highway traffic volume in a short period of time. In order to better improve the service level of a tourist service area by predicting the short-term traffic volume of the toll station around the tourist service area, this paper proposes a model combining a convolutional neural network and a gated recurrent unit (CNN plus GRU) to solve the problem of short-term traffic volume prediction. The data from 17 toll stations of the Yu’an Expressway in Guizhou Province were selected for the experiment to test the prediction effect of the CNN plus GRU-based model. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy, the MAE and RMSE, are 1.8101 and 2.7021, respectively, for the toll stations with lower traffic volumes, and 3.820 and 5.172, respectively, for the toll stations with higher traffic volumes. Compared with a single model, the model’s prediction accuracy is improved, to different degrees. Therefore, the use of a convolutional neural network operation is better when the total traffic volume is low, considering the algorithm’s time and error. When using the combined convolutional neural network and gated recurrent unit model and when the total traffic volume is high, the algorithm error is significantly reduced and the prediction results are better. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Capturing complex and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies of traffic data is of great importance for accurate and real-time traffic forecasting in intelligent transportation systems. The spatial-temporal dependency between traffic locations is often dynamic, which means the correlation between the traffic status of different locations changes jointly over their spatial distance and the time slice they are in. Most of the existing Graph Convolutional Network-based methods usually capture spatial and temporal dependencies separately and then combine them in a parallel or serial mechanism to capture the spatial-temporal features. They always utilize the predefined static graph structure to capture both local correlations and global dependencies in the same time slice. These methods are incapable of directly learning dynamic spatial-temporal dependency across time slices. Meanwhile, it is challenging to learn the spatiotemporal correlation knowledge among traffic locations only by using neural networks. To address these issues, we propose a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Adjacent Graph Convolutional Network (DSTAGCN), which connects the latest time slice with each past time slice to construct the spatial-temporal graph. DSTAGCN can directly learn the global spatial dependency across time and simultaneously capture the spatial-temporal dependencies through graph convolution. Since fuzzy theory make it possible to represent uncertain relationships, a simplified fuzzy neural network that integrates fuzzy systems and neural networks is designed to help generating the graph adjacency matrix representing the dynamic adjacency correlations. Experiments on public datasets show that our method outperforms baselines with fast convergence.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - There is substantial demand for high network traffic due to the emergence of new highly demanding services and applications such as the internet of things (IoT), big data, blockchains, and next-generation networks like 5G and beyond. Therefore, network resource planning and forecasting play a vital role in better resource optimization. Accordingly, forecasting accuracy has become essential for network operation and planning to maintain the minimum quality of service (QoS) for real-time applications. In this paper, a hybrid network- bandwidth slice forecasting model that combines long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network and various local smoothing techniques to enhance the network forecasting model's accuracy was proposed and analyzed. The results show that the proposed hybrid forecasting model can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy with minimal data loss. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - This paper proposes a framework for short-term traffic breakdown probability calculation using a Variational LSTM neural network model. Considering that traffic breakdown is a stochastic event, this forecast framework was devised to produce distributions as outputs, which cannot be achieved using standard deterministic recurrent neural networks. Therefore, the model counts on the robustness of neural networks but also includes the stochastic characteristics of highway capacity. The framework consists of three main steps: (i) build and train a probabilistic speed forecasting neural network, (ii) forecast speed distributions with the trained model using Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and therefore perform Bayesian approximation, and (iii) establish a speed threshold that characterizes breakdown occurrence and calculate breakdown probabilities based on the speed distributions. The proposed framework produced an efficient control over traffic breakdown occurrence, can deal with many independent variables or features, and can be combined with traffic management strategies. © 2023 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

AB  - Accurate traffic speed forecasting is a prerequisite for anticipating future traffic status and increasing the resilience of intelligent transportation systems. However, most studies ignore the involvement of context information ubiquitously distributed over the urban environment to boost speed prediction. The diversity and complexity of context information also hinder incorporating it into traffic forecasting. Therefore, this study proposes a multimodal context-based graph convolutional neural network (MCGCN) model to fuse context data into traffic speed prediction, including spatial and temporal contexts. The proposed model comprises three modules, ie (a) hierarchical spatial embedding to learn spatial representations by organizing spatial contexts from different dimensions, (b) multivariate temporal modeling to learn temporal representations by capturing dependencies of multivariate temporal contexts and (c) attention-based multimodal fusion to integrate traffic speed with the spatial and temporal context representations for multi-step speed prediction. We conduct extensive experiments in Singapore. Compared to the baseline model (spatial-temporal graph convolutional network, STGCN), our results demonstrate the importance of multimodal contexts with the mean-absolute-error improvement of 0.29 km/h, 0.45 km/h and 0.89 km/h in 30-min, 60-min and 120-min speed prediction, respectively. We also explore how different contexts affect traffic speed forecasting, providing references for stakeholders to understand the relationship between context information and transportation systems. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Anomaly detection over traffic data is crucial for transportation management and abnormal behavior identification. An anomaly in real-world scenarios usually causes abnormal observations for multiple detectors in an extended period. However, existing anomaly detection methods overly leverage the single or isolated feature interdependent contextual information in anomalies, inevitably dropping the detection performance. In this paper, we propose S-DKFN (Seasonal Deep Kalman Filter Network), to identify abnormal patterns with a long duration and wide coverage. S-DKFN models traffic data with a graph and simultaneously investigates the spatial and temporal features to hunt abnormal behaviors. Specifically, a dilation temporal convolutional network (TCN) is used to merge the multi-granular seasonal features and a graph convolution network (GCN) to extract spatial features. The outputs of TCN and GCN are then fed to long-short term models (LSTM) and merged by Kalman filters for denoising. An encoder-decoder module is introduced to predict traffic attributes with seasonal features. The mean squared errors (MSE) of the predictions are considered the anomaly scores. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed S-DKFN framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in detecting anomalies with long-duration and wide-coverage, especially its ability to detect accidents. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The traffic forecast system is critical in intelligent transportation system. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks will play a significant role in future intelligent transportation system (VANET). On the highways, they give perfect service to the drivers. For traffic control systems, information systems for drivers and passengers, such as speed, journey time, congestion, emergency services, weather alerts, and many more services, pattern clarity and traffic forecast are critical. Problematic nonlinear pattern complicates these systems. This study offers a Cloud Based Random Forest Algorithm to prevent such issues (CRFA). For road facilities, the Random Forest approach is used to expect the next condition of traffic based on traffic changing in brief intervals of time. The suggested approach employs Random Forest on VANET to evaluate route optimization to get a congestion free road, accident detection, and prevention, as well as providing various services to drivers and passengers while maintaining QOS. Because it is based on the cloud and the Global Positioning System, even in foggy or misty conditions, each vehicle will know exactly where it is going, and if a target approaches another vehicle, a flash of warning will appear on the screen with a loud beep sound, resulting in the automatic reduction of speed to maintain the speed and distance between the vehicles. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Before traffic forecasting, it is usually necessary to aggregate the information by a certain length of time. An aggregation size that is too short will make the data unstable and cause the forecast result to be too biased. On the other hand, if the aggregation size is too large, the data information will be lost, resulting in the forecast results tending towards an average or slow response. With the development of intelligent transportation systems, especially the development of urban traffic control systems, high requirements are placed on the real-time accuracy of traffic forecasting. Therefore, it is an essential topic of traffic forecasting research to determine aggregation sizes. In this paper, the mutual information between the forecast input information and the forecast result and the sequence complexity of the forecast result measured by approximate entropy, sample entropy, and fuzzy entropy are considered; then, the optimal data aggregation size is given. To verify the proposed method, the validated data obtained from the simulation is aggregated and calculated with different aggregation sizes, then used for forecasting. By comparing the prediction performance of different aggregate sizes, the optimal aggregate size was found to reduce MSE by 14–30%. The results show that the method proposed in this paper is helpful for selecting the optimal data aggregation size in forecasting and can improve the performance of prediction. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Despite the extensive efforts, accurate traffic time series forecasting remains challenging. By taking into account the non-linear nature of traffic in-depth, we propose a novel ST-CRMF model consisting of the Compensated Residual Matrix Factorization with Spatial-Temporal regularization for graph-based traffic time series forecasting. Our model inherits the benefits of MF and regularizer optimization and further carries out the compensatory modeling of the spatial-temporal correlations through a well-designed bi-directional residual structure. Of particular concern is that MF modeling and later residual learning share and synchronize iterative updates as equal training parameters, which considerably alleviates the error propagation problem that associates with rolling forecasting. Besides, most of the existing prediction models have neglected the difficult-to-avoid issue of missing traffic data; the ST-CRMF model can repair the possible missing value while fulfilling the forecasting tasks. After testing the effects of key parameters on model performance, the numerous experimental results confirm that our ST-CRMF model can efficiently capture the comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies and significantly outperform those state-of-the-art models in the short-to-long terms (5-/15-/30-/60-min) traffic forecasting tasks on the open Seattle-Loop and METR-LA traffic datasets. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Speed prediction is a crucial yet complicated task for intelligent transportation systems. The challenge derives from the complex spatiotemporal dependencies of traffic parameters. In the past few years, deep neural networks have achieved the best traffic speed prediction performance. However, most models depend on short-term input sequences to predict short/long-term traffic speed (e.g., predicting speed for the next hour using data from the past hour). These models fail to consider the daily and weekly periodic behavior of traffic. Another problem posed by neural networks is the lack of interpretability as they often operate as 'black boxes'. In this paper, an attention-based multi-encoder-decoder (Att-MED) model is proposed to predict traffic speed. The model uses convolutional-LSTMs to capture the spatiotemporal relationship of multiple input sequences, namely short-term, daily and weekly traffic patterns. The model also employs an LSTM to model the output predictions sequentially. Furthermore, attention mechanism is used to weigh the contribution of each traffic sequence towards the output predictions. The proposed network architecture, when trained end-to-end, results in a superior prediction accuracy compared to baseline models. In addition to contributing towards performance, the attention mechanism creates weight values, which when visualized, provide insights into the decision-making process of the neural network, and consequently produce explainable outputs. Att-MED's extracted attention weights highlight the contribution of daily and weekly periodic input towards speed prediction. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Knowledge about future traffic in backbone optical networks may greatly improve a range of tasks that Communications Service Providers (CSPs) have to face. This work proposes a procedure for long-term traffic forecasting in optical networks. We formulate a long-terT traffic forecasting problem as an ordinal classification task. Due to the optical networks’ (and other network technologies’) characteristics, traffic forecasting has been realized by predicting future traffic levels rather than the exact traffic volume. We examine different machine learning (ML) algorithms and compare them with time series algorithms methods. To evaluate the developed ML models, we use a quality metric, which considers the network resource usage. Datasets used during research are based on real traffic patterns presented by Internet Exchange Point in Seattle. Our study shows that ML algorithms employed for long-term traffic forecasting problem obtain high values of quality metrics. Additionally, the final choice of the ML algorithm for the forecasting task should depend on CSPs expectations. © 2023 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in the effective operation of managed lanes, as traffic demand and revenue are relatively volatile given parallel competition from adjacent, toll-free general purpose lanes. This paper proposes a deep learning framework to forecast short-term traffic volumes and speeds on managed lanes. A network of convolutional neural networks (CNN) was used to detect spatial features. Volume and speed were converted into heatmaps feeding into the CNN layers and temporal relationships were detected by a recurrent neural network (RNN) layer. A dense layer was used for the final prediction. Six months of historical volume and speed data on the I-580 Express Lanes in California, United States were utilized in this case study. Computational results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven deep learning framework in forecasting short-term traffic volumes and speeds on managed lanes. © 2022, Amirkabir University of Technology.

AB  - Recently, smart cities have emerged as one of the most important global trends initiated by many countries. The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G connectivity enables numerous smart system technologies. One of the most critical aspects of smart cities is Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) which allow for accurate traffic forecasting. Existing traffic forecasting approaches use simple models based on univariate historical datasets or fuse historical traffic data with other datasets, such as air pollution records. These techniques interpreted traffic data points as independent samples despite their time dependency, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose an enhanced traffic prediction approach using the sliding window technique. The proposed approach transforms the traffic data points into time-series sequence data using the sliding window technique. Moreover, the proposed approach exploits traffic and pollution datasets for multivariate traffic prediction. The proposed approach compares different machine/deep learning techniques for prediction and evaluates their accuracy compared to a baseline benchmark. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the evaluation metrics values for the tested machine and deep learning techniques by an average value of 36% and 24%, respectively, compared to the base-line benchmark. © (2023), (Universitatea "Stefan cel Mare" din Suceava).

AB  - Network-level metro passenger flow prediction has always been one of the most important but most challenging scientific problems in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, conventional methods ignore the multi-dimensional topological relationships in the subway system or directly learn from the physical topological structure and fail to explore the spatial-temporal evolution of passenger flow fully. Moreover, due to the highly punctual operation feature, the metro system has high-degree controllability and regularity, which is usually not considered in the traditional model. To address this problem, we model a metro system based on various topological structures and propose a novel spatial-temporal multi-graph convolutional wavelet network (ST-MGCWN) with unique metro system state characteristics. The core of this approach is to combine the domain knowledge of transportation and deep learning models. To be precise, there are three main modules in the proposed framework: (i). The graph wavelet convolution captures the dynamic spatial dependence between nodes on the established multiple graphs and synthesizes topological features through the graph fusion module. (ii). The various approaches based on the gated recurrent model are designed to capture the long-term periodicity and short-term trends. (iii). The transformation of the metro state characteristics reflects the change of the train density on the operation diagram, which is approximated by the distribution of the local peaks of passenger flow. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves up to about 5% improvement over the state-of-the-art approach for the network-level passenger flow prediction task. In addition, we conduct a detailed analysis of the contribution of each component to enhance interpretability and reliability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Spatial–temporal graph modeling has been widely studied in many fields, such as traffic forecasting and energy analysis, where data has time and space properties. Existing methods focus on capturing stable and dynamic spatial correlations by constructing physical and virtual graphs along with graph convolution and temporal modeling. However, existing methods tending to smooth node features may obscure the spatial–temporal patterns among nodes. Worse, the graph structure is not always available in some fields, while the manually constructed stable or dynamic graphs cannot necessarily reflect the true spatial correlations either. This paper proposes a Subgraph-Aware Graph Structure Revision network (SAGSR) to overcome these limitations. Architecturally, a subgraph-aware structure revision graph convolution module (SASR-GCM) is designed, which revises the learned stable graph to obtain a dynamic one to automatically infer the dynamics of spatial correlations. Each of these two graphs is separated into one homophilic subgraph and one heterophilic subgraph by a subgraph-aware graph convolution mechanism, which aggregates similar nodes in the homophilic subgraph with positive weights, while keeping nodes with dissimilar features in the heterophilic subgraph mutually away with negative aggregation weights to avoid pattern obfuscation. By combining a gated multi-scale temporal convolution module (GMS-TCM) for temporal modeling, SAGSR can efficiently capture the spatial–temporal correlations and extract complex spatial–temporal graph features. Extensive experiments, conducted on two specific tasks: traffic flow forecasting and energy consumption forecasting, indicate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach over several competitive baselines. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - How to model the complex spatial-temporal relation in traffic data is an important problem for precisely predicting the future status of a city traffic system. Existing traffic forecasting methods rarely consider the traffic state trend, and the robust spatial relation has not been well explored. To tackle these issues, we design a novel Robust And Hierarchical spatial Relation Analysis (RAHRA) method to calculate the local-period spatial relation, which applies temporal context information in both traffic state and trend similarities. This could capture abundant traffic patterns and learn stable and comprehensive spatial relations for accurate traffic forecasting. Furthermore, we introduce a Temporal Attention Module (TAM) to capture the temporal features and propose a Future Feature Inference Module (FFIM) to infer the future traffic information. Experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of wireless communication and edge computing, UAV-assisted networking technology has great significance in many application scenarios such as traffic forecasting, emergency rescue, military reconnaissance. However, due to dynamic topology changes of Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANET), frequent identity authentication is easy to cause the instability of communications between UAV nodes, which makes FANET face serious identity security threats. Therefore, it is an inevitable trend to build a secure and reliable FANET. In this paper, we propose a lightweight mutual identity authentication scheme based on adaptive trust strategy for Flying Ad-hoc Networks (ATS-LIA), which selects the UAV with the highest trust value from the UAV swarm to authenticate with the ground control station (GCS). While ensuring the communication security, we reduce the energy consumption of UAV to the greatest extent, and reduce the frequent identity authentication between UAV and GCS. Through the security game verification under the random oracle model, it is proved that the proposed method can effectively resist some attacks, effectively reduce the computational overhead, and ensure the communication security of FANET. The results show that compared with the existing schemes, the proposed ATS-LIA scheme has lower computational overhead. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic forecasting has emerged as an important task for developing intelligent transportation systems. Recent works focus on representing traffic as graph operation and using graph neural networks for spatial–temporal prediction. Most of the approaches assume a prede¯ned graph structure based on node distances. However, spatial dependencies change over time in many scenarios of traffic °ow. In this regard, this study takes an investigation capturing the spatial and temporal dependencies with no prior knowledge structure of traffic road networks. Speci¯cally, we propose a multi-step prediction model named Dynamic Spatial Transformer WaveNet Network (DSTWN) to capture the dynamic conditions and directions of traffic °ow in which a temporal convolution layer is adopted for the long time sequence and a spatial transformer layer is proposed to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a new traffic dataset, which is collected from the vehicle detection system in an urban area (UVDS). In particular, compared with existing benchmark traffic data, UVDS contains more complicated spatial information, which is similar to many real-world scenarios of traffic °ow. Experiments on both benchmark traffic datasets indicate the promising results of DSTWN compared with state-of-the-art models in this research ¯eld. © The Author(s)

AB  - In today’s data-driven world, time series forecasting is an intensively investigated temporal data mining technique. In practice, there is a range of forecasting techniques that have been proven to be efficient at capturing different aspects of an input. For instance, classic linear forecasting models such as seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (S-ARIMA) models are known to capture the trends and seasonality evident in temporal datasets. In contrast, neural-network-based forecasting approaches are known to be best at capturing nonlinearity. Despite such differences, most forecasting techniques inherently assume that models are fitted using a single input. In practice, there are often cases where we cannot deploy forecasting models in this manner. For instance, in most wireless communication traffic forecasting problems, temporal datasets are defined by taking samples from hundreds of base stations. Moreover, the base stations are expected to have spatial correlation due to user mobility, land use, settlement patterns, etc. Thus, in such cases, it is often advised that forecasting should be approached using clusters that group the base stations based on their traffic patterns. However, when this approach is used, the quality of the cluster centroids and the overall cluster formation process is expected to have a significant impact on the performance of forecasting models. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of representation learning for cluster formation and cluster centroid definition, which in turn improves the quality of cluster-level forecasting. We demonstrate this concept using data traffics collected from 729 wireless base stations. In general, based on the experimental results, the representation learning approach outperforms cluster-level forecasting models based on classical clustering techniques such as K-means and dynamic time warping barycenter averaging K-means (DBA K-means). © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction in urban areas is essential in the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Short Term Traffic Flow (STTF) prediction impacts traffic flow series, where an estimation of the number of vehicles will appear during the next instance of time per hour. Precise STTF is critical in Intelligent Transportation System. Various extinct systems aim for short-term traffic forecasts, ensuring a good precision outcome which was a significant task over the past few years. The main objective of this paper is to propose a new model to predict STTF for every hour of a day. In this paper, we have proposed a novel hybrid algorithm utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) named PALKNN. Firstly, PCA removes unwanted information from the dataset and selects essential features. Secondly, SAE is used to reduce the dimension of input data using one-hot encoding so the model can be trained with better speed. Thirdly, LSTM takes the input from SAE, where the data is sorted in ascending order based on the important features and generates the derived value. Finally, KNN Regressor takes information from LSTM to predict traffic flow. The forecasting performance of the PALKNN model is investigated with Open Road Traffic Statistics dataset, Great Britain, UK. This paper enhanced the traffic flow prediction for every hour of a day with a minimal error value. An extensive experimental analysis was performed on the benchmark dataset. The evaluated results indicate the significant improvement of the proposed PALKNN model over the recent approaches such as KNN, SARIMA, Logistic Regression, RNN, and LSTM in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.07%, mean square error (MSE) of 4.1%, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.04%. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

AB  - With deep learning (DL) outperforming conventional methods for different tasks, much effort has been devoted to utilizing DL in various domains. Researchers and developers in the traffic domain have also designed and improved DL models for forecasting tasks such as estimation of traffic speed and time of arrival. However, there exist many challenges in analyzing DL models due to the black-box property of DL models and complexity of traffic data (i.e., spatio-temporal dependencies). Collaborating with domain experts, we design a visual analytics system, AttnAnalyzer, that enables users to explore how DL models make predictions by allowing effective spatio-temporal dependency analysis. The system incorporates dynamic time warping (DTW) and Granger causality tests for computational spatio-temporal dependency analysis while providing map, table, line chart, and pixel views to assist user to perform dependency and model behavior analysis. For the evaluation, we present three case studies showing how AttnAnalyzer can effectively explore model behaviors and improve model performance in two different road networks. We also provide domain expert feedback.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Spatiotemporal models that incorporate information about the relationships between traffic flows over space and time have recently become the mainstream of urban traffic forecasting. Many algorithms have been developed to learn the structure of spatiotemporal relationships - the travel time-based, cross-correlation, graphical lasso, mutual information, and random forest methods, among several others. In this paper, we address two issues of spatiotemporal relationship learning. First, we suggest the application of ensemble techniques (ranking- and voting-based) that combine the advantages of individual algorithms and allow more robust structures to be obtained for learning spatiotemporal relationships. Second, we propose strategies that enable discovery of their dynamics and provide extensive information on traffic flows for the responsive learning of spatiotemporal relationships. In addition to the widely used forecasting performance (estimated for the spatially regularised vector autoregression model, the spatiotemporal k-nearest neighbour algorithm, and the high-order graph convolutional artificial neural network), we compare the estimated spatiotemporal relationship structures using their complexity and stability metrics and demonstrate the importance of these characteristics. A multitude of numerical experiments using a large citywide traffic data set are conducted, and the results demonstrate the preferences of ensemble learning and the strengths of the proposed learning strategies.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is essential in the development of intelligent transportation systems, as it enables the formulation of effective traffic dispatching strategies and contributes to the reduction of traffic congestion. The abundance of research focused on modeling complex spatiotemporal correlations for accurate traffic prediction, however many of these prior works perform feature extraction based solely on prior graph structures, thereby overlooking the latent graph connectivity inherent in the data and degrading a decline in prediction accuracy. In this study, we present a novel Attention-based Multiple Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (AMGCRN) to capture dynamic and latent spatiotemporal correlations in traffic data. The proposed model comprises two spatial feature extraction modules. Firstly, a dot product attention mechanism is utilized to construct an adaptive graph to extract the similarity of road structure. Secondly, the graph attention mechanism is leveraged to enhance the extraction of local traffic flow features. The outputs of these two spatial feature extraction modules are integrated through a gating mechanism and fed into a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to make spatiotemporal interaction predictions. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AMGCRN over state-of-the-art baselines. The results suggest that the proposed model is effective in capturing complex spatiotemporal correlations and achieving about 1% improvements in traffic forecasting. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is critical in improving safety, stability, and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Despite years of studies, accurate traffic prediction still faces the following challenges, including modeling the dynamics of trafﬁc data along both temporal and spatial dimensions, and capturing the periodicity and the spatial heterogeneity of trafﬁc data, and the problem is more difficult for long-term forecast. In this paper, we propose an Attention based Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ASTGNN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, in the temporal dimension, we design a novel self-attention mechanism that is capable of utilizing the local context, which is specialized for numerical sequence representation transformation. It enables our prediction model to capture the temporal dynamics of traffic data and to enjoy global receptive ﬁelds that is beneficial for long-term forecast. In the spatial dimension, we develop a dynamic graph convolution module, employing self-attention to capture the spatial correlations in a dynamic manner. Furthermore, we explicitly model the periodicity and capture the spatial heterogeneity through embedding modules. Experiments on five real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that ASTGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This work enhances the machine-to-human communication between electronic toll collection (ETC) systems and drivers by providing an AM broadcast service to deployed ETC systems. This study is the first to show that ultra-high radio frequency identification signals can be received by an AM radio receiver due to the presence of the nonlinearity effect in the AM receiver. Such a phenomenon allows the development of a previously infeasible cross-technology and cross-frequency communication, called Tagcaster, which converts an ETC reader to an AM station for broadcasting short messages (e.g., charged-fees and traffic forecast) to drivers at tollbooths. The key innovation in this work is the engineering of Tagcaster over off-the-shelf ETC systems using shadow carrier and baseband whitening without the need for hardware nor firmware changes. This feature allows zero-cost rapid deployment in the existing ETC infrastructure. Two prototypes of Tagcaster are designed, implemented, and evaluated over four general and five vehicle-mounted AM receivers (e.g., Toyota, Audi, and Jetta). Experiments reveal that Tagcaster can provide good-quality (PESQ>2) and stable AM broadcasting service with a 30 m coverage range. Tagcaster remarkably improves user experience at ETC stations, and two-thirds of volunteer drivers rate it with a score of 4+ out of 5.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Globalization has resulted in increases in air transportation demand and air passenger traffic. With the increases in air traffic, airports face challenges related to infrastructure, air services, and future development. Air traffic forecasting is essential to ensuring appropriate investment in airports. In this study, we combined fuzzy theory with support vector regression (SVR) to develop a fuzzy SVR (FSVR) model for forecasting international airport traffic. This model was used to predict the air traffic volumes at the world’s 10 busiest airports in terms of air traffic in 2018. The predictions were made for the period from August 2014 to December 2019. For fuzzy time series, the developed FSVR model can consider historical air traffic changes. The FSVR model can suitably divide air traffic changes into appropriate fuzzy sets, generate membership function values, and establish fuzzy relations to produce fuzzy interpolated values with minimal errors. Thus, in the prediction of continuous data, the fuzzy data with the smallest errors can be subjected to SVR to find the optimal hyperplane model with the minimum distance to the appropriate support vector sample points. The performance of the proposed model was compared with those of five other models. Of the compared models, the FSVR model exhibited the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error, and root mean square error for all types of traffic at all of the airports analyzed; all of the MAPE values were below 2.5. The FSVR model can predict future growth trends in air traffic, air passenger flows, aircraft flows, and logistics. An airport authority can use this model to analyze the existing operational facilities and service capacity, find bottlenecks in airport operations, and create a blueprint for future development. The findings revealed that implementing a hybrid modeling approach, specifically the FSVR model, can significantly enhance the performance of the SVR model. The FSVR model allows airlines to predict traffic growth patterns, identify viable new destinations, optimize their schedules or fleet, make accurate marketing decisions, and plan traffic effectively. The FSVR model can guide the timely construction of appropriate airport facilities with accurate predictions. Rapid, cost-effective, efficient, and balanced transportation planning enables the provision of fast, cost-effective, comfortable, safe, and convenient passenger and cargo services while ensuring the proper planning of the airport’s capacity for land-side transportation connections. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The most crucial component of any smart city traffic management system is traffic flow prediction. It can assist a driver in selecting the most efficient route to their destination. The digitalization of closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems has resulted in more effective and capable surveillance imaging systems for security applications. The number of automobiles on the world’s highways has steadily increased in recent decades. However, road capacity has not developed at the same rate, resulting in significantly increasing congestion. The model learning mechanism cannot be guided or improved by prior domain knowledge of real-world problems. In reality, symmetrical features are common in many real-world research objects. To mitigate this severe situation, the researchers chose adaptive traffic management to make intelligent and efficient use of the current infrastructure. Data grow exponentially and become a complex item that must be managed. Unstructured data are a subset of big data that are difficult to process and have volatile properties. CCTV cameras are used in traffic management to monitor a specific point on the roadway. CCTV generates unstructured data in the form of images and videos. Because of the data’s intricacy, these data are challenging to process. This study proposes using big data analytics to transform real-time unstructured data from CCTV into information that can be shown on a web dashboard. As a Hadoop-based architectural stack that can serve as the ICT backbone for managing unstructured data efficiently, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) stores several sorts of data using the Hadoop file storage system, a high-performance integrated virtual environment (HIVE) tables, and non-relational storage. Traditional computer vision algorithms are incapable of processing such massive amounts of visual data collected in real-time. However, the inferiority of traffic data and the quality of unit information are always symmetrical phenomena. As a result, there is a need for big data analytics with machine learning, which entails processing and analyzing vast amounts of visual data, such as photographs or videos, to uncover semantic patterns that may be interpreted. As a result, smart cities require a more accurate traffic flow prediction system. In comparison to other recent methods applied to the dataset, the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy of 98.21%. In this study, we look at the construction of a secure CCTV strategy that predicts traffic from CCTV surveillance using real-time traffic prediction analysis with generative adversarial networks (GAN) and HDFS. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In road networks, attribute information carried by road segment nodes, such as weather and points of interest (POI), exhibit strong heterogeneity and often involve one-to-many or many-to-one relationships. However, research on such heterogeneity in traffic prediction is relatively limited. Our research examines how varying the network propagation pattern based on the degree of node-to-node heterogeneity of information affects the model prediction performance. Specifically, at the node level, we use knowledge embedding to generate knowledge vectors that quantify the heterogeneity among the attribute information of a node. At the road network level, we calculate a homogeneity adjacency matrix that captures both the topological structure of the road network and the similarity of node heterogeneity. This adjacency matrix assigns different weights to neighbors based on their homogeneity, guiding the propagation of graph convolutional networks (GCN). Finally, we separate the representation of propagation into self-representation and neighbor representation to extract multi-attribute information, including self, homogeneity, and heterogeneity. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the incorporation of our homogeneity adjacency matrix leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of short-term and long-term prediction compared with previous work on homogeneous and single-dimensional information. Furthermore, our approach maintains its performance advantage over baseline models under different embedding dimensions and parameter settings. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The detection of communities in graph datasets provides insight about a graph’s underlying structure and is an important tool for various domains such as social sciences, marketing, traffic forecast, and drug discovery. While most existing algorithms provide fast approaches for community detection, their results usually contain strictly separated communities. However, most datasets would semantically allow for or even require overlapping communities that can only be determined at much higher computational cost. We build on an efficient algorithm, FOX, that detects such overlapping communities. FOX measures the closeness of a node to a community by approximating the count of triangles which that node forms with that community. We propose LAZYFOX, a multi-threaded adaptation of the FOX algorithm, which provides even faster detection without an impact on community quality. This allows for the analyses of significantly larger and more complex datasets. LAZYFOX enables overlapping community detection on complex graph datasets with millions of nodes and billions of edges in days instead of weeks. As part of this work, LAZYFOX’s implementation was published and is available as a tool under an MIT licence at https://github.com/TimGarrels/LazyFox. © 2023 Garrels et al

AB  - Artificial intelligence has attracted great attentions in the field of traffic flow forecasting. Graph neural network (GNN), as one of the most popular methods, capable of processing non-Euclidean graph-structured data, which makes it suitable for traffic forecasting problems. However, existing GNN based methods highly rely on fixed coefficients calculated from spatial information, while practical changes of lanes, surrounding environment, and infrastructure conditions may lead to dynamic spatial dependences. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic graph attention network model (TransGAT), which includes two phases. Firstly, Node Embedding algorithm based on dynamic attention mechanism is proposed to capture spatial dependency information. Then, the temporal features captured by the Gated Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is added by using Skip Connection so as to construct a spatio-temporal capture module. TransGAT model is further validated in the two real datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. The results show that TransGAT model shows better performances in the short-term (15 min), medium-term (30 min) and long-term (60 min) forecasting. Compared with the baseline method, the forecasting error is reduced by about 13%. © 2022

AB  - The article discusses the issue of modelling traffic flows and the transport network. Faced with an increase in the number of vehicles in road networks, the problem of congestion and the need to optimise traffic and adapt the transport infrastructure to changing demand are growing, especially in large cities. With this in mind, the authors of this publication developed a model of the road network in the north-eastern part of the Warsaw agglomeration based on the proposed algorithm. Two methods were used to optimise the distribution of traffic flows: the Nash equilibrium and the Stackelberg approach. The Nash equilibrium assumes the aim of achieving equal average times on all roads for each origin–destination (O-D) pair. This describes the state pursued by a decentralised system guided by the individual benefits of the traffic users. On the contrary, the Stackelberg approach aims to achieve optimal travel times for the entire system. The study was carried out for three scenarios that differed in the assumed traffic demand on the road network. The basic scenario assumed the average hourly traffic demand during the morning peak hour based on traffic measurements. On the other hand, the two alternative scenarios were developed as a 10% variation in traffic volumes from the baseline scenario. On the basis of the results, it was concluded that an increase in traffic volumes for all O-D pairs could result in a decrease in traffic volumes on some links of the road network. This means that the transport network is a complex system and any change in parameters can cause significant and difficult to predict changes. Therefore, the proposed approach is useful in terms of traffic forecasting for road networks under conditions of changing traffic flow volumes. Additionally, the total travel time for the entire system differed for each scenario by a percentage difference of 0.67–1.07% between the optimal solution according to the Nash equilibrium and the Stackelberg approach. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Short-term traffic forecasting is a key element in proactive traffic management, e.g., mitigating the negative effect of impending congestion through appropriate capacity allocation at signalized intersections. In this study, we develop a data-driven methodology for reliably and robustly predicting impending stable congestion. By incorporating feature engineering techniques into an iterative machine learning process, we develop a prediction model that can be intuitively understood by traffic experts and is amenable to diagnostics during implementation. Our iterative machine learning process combines the embedded and filter approaches for feature selection with the use of expert knowledge to create aggregative input variables. The embedded approach is represented by application of a decision tree algorithm, while the filter approach is reflected in use of the mean decrease in accuracy output of a random forest algorithm for identifying expressive variables. We tested the methodology by applying it to field data from a sub-network in Tel Aviv. We demonstrated a reduction in the number of decision tree input variables from 66 raw variables to the five most effective aggregative ones, while achieving statistically significant improvement in all performance indicators. The identification rate of stable congestion increased from 65% to 74% while the robustness of the results was enhanced: the standard deviations of the identification and false alarm rates fell from 8% to 3%, respectively, to 5% and 2%. © 2022 Periodical Offices of Changâ€™an University

AB  - There is a recent surge in the development of spatio-temporal forecasting models in the transportation domain. Long-range traffic forecasting, however, remains a challenging task due to the intricate and extensive spatio-temporal correlations observed in traffic networks. Current works primarily rely on road networks with graph structures and learn representations using graph neural networks (GNNs), but this approach suffers from over-smoothing problem in deep architectures. To tackle this problem, recent methods introduced the com-bination of GNNs with residual connections or neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, current graph ODE models face two key limitations in feature extraction: (1) they lean towards global temporal patterns, overlooking local patterns that are important for un-expected events; and (2) they lack dynamic semantic edges in their architectural design. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called Graph-based Multi-ODE Neural Networks (GRAM-ODE) which is designed with multiple connective ODE-GNN modules to learn better representations by capturing different views of complex local and global dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies. We also add some techniques like shared weights and divergence constraints into the intermediate layers of distinct ODE-GNN modules to further improve their communication towards the forecasting task. Our extensive set of experiments con-ducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of GRAM-ODE com-pared with state-of-the-art baselines as well as the contribution of different components to the overall performance.

AB  - In this work, a newly dynamic step size-based 5G charging mechanism was proposed with the introduction of random forest algorithm, user daily traffic forecast model, and RG distribution model for the pressure release on charging system caused by the growing consumption demands based on the behavior feature selection of subscribers. After the verification of the dynamic step size mechanism, optimization analysis was performed from three aspects, including authorization step statistical results, Charging Data Record, and timely reminders by utilizing the real monthly traffic usage data of 13,000 users from China Telecom. Result shows that the amount of charging messages between the network elements and the charging systems decreases by about 35%, and the timeliness rate of reminder service increases by approximately 30%. This research realizes an innovative updating of traditional charging systems to effectively improve the efficiency of the 5G charging system and achieves a reduction in system maintenance and resource occupation. Along with the improvement of service quality and user experience, this work provides an innovation method for operators and different associated businesses to tackle new challenges in 5G.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic prediction is the cornerstone of intelligent transportation system. Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for the applications of smart cities, i.e., intelligent traffic management and urban planning. Although various methods are proposed for spatio-temporal modeling, they ignore the dynamic characteristics of correlations among locations on road network. Meanwhile, most Recurrent Neural Network based works are not efficient enough due to their recurrent operations. Additionally, there is a severe lack of fair comparison among different methods on the same datasets. To address the above challenges, in this article, we propose a novel traffic prediction framework, named Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DGCRN). In DGCRN, hyper-networks are designed to leverage and extract dynamic characteristics from node attributes, while the parameters of dynamic filters are generated at each time step. We filter the node embeddings and then use them to generate dynamic graph, which is integrated with pre-defined static graph. As far as we know, we are first to employ a generation method to model fine topology of dynamic graph at each time step. Furthermore, to enhance efficiency and performance, we employ a training strategy for DGCRN by restricting the iteration number of decoder during forward and backward propagation. Finally, a reproducible standardized benchmark and a brand new representative traffic dataset are opened for fair comparison and further research. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms 15 baselines consistently.

AB  - Traffic forecasting aims to capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies and non-linear dynamics, which plays an indispensable role in intelligent transportation systems and other domains like neuroscience, climate, etc. Most recent works rely on graph convolutional networks (GCN) to model the dependencies and the dynamics. However, the over-smoothing issue of GCN would produce indistinguishable features among nodes, leading to poor expressivity and weak capability of modeling complex dependencies and dynamics. To address this issue, we present a novel clustering spatial-temporal (ClusterST) unit, which incorporates unsupervised learning into GCN for extracting discriminative features. Specifically, we first exploit a neural network to learn a dynamic clustering, i.e., learning to partition the neighbors of each node into clusters at each time step. Two probabilistic losses are proposed to improve the separability of clusters. Then, the extracted features of different clusters can be distinguished. Based on the dynamically formed clusters, a vanilla GCN is applied to aggregate features within each cluster. By purely exploiting such a ClusterST unit, large improvements over the state-of-the-art are achieved. Furthermore, ClusterST units with a different number of clusters can be regarded as basic components to construct an inception-like ClusterST network for going deeper. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large-scale traffic datasets and observe an average improvement of 18.19% and 7.62% over state-of-the-art baselines, respectively. The code and models will be publicly available.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Road Side Units (RSUs) are an integral component of Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANET) along with connected and autonomous vehicles. RSUs have been used to host numerous traffic sensing and control mechanisms to enhance transportation throughput in terms of safety, congestion avoidance, route planning, etc. In order to reduce installation and maintenance costs and associated network and security overhead, it is highly desirable to deploy these RSUs optimally, particularly in strategic and influential positions. While too many RSUs may increase overhead, too few RSUs may fail to map the entire region properly, resulting in erroneous computations. This paper aims to address this trade-off by incorporating a novel scheme called Intersection Influence Analysis System for Optimal RSU Deployment (IIA-ORD). The primary objective of IIA-ORD is achieved through modelling the transportation network as connected graphs and executing a modified K-shell and TOPSIS-based framework. Specifically, the network vertices are mapped with road intersections, and live traffic data is used to analyze various statistical measures, leading to the identification of influential junctions. Extensive performance analysis in an open-source simulation platform backed by real-time data justifies the performance superiority of the IIA-ORD system over existing RSU deployment strategies in terms of an overall number of deployed RSUs, average coverage, coverage time ratio, packet delivery ratio, and delay. The system is validated by a traffic forecasting application. The RSU is equipped with the Stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (SBi-LSTM) based traffic prediction model, under which the RSU of a particular junction predicts the traffic congestion of the entire region without the deployment of additional RSUs. Comparative analysis records high accuracy with low loss values for the proposed model in relation to the vanilla LSTM model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Currently, microservices are trending as the most popular software application design architecture. Software organisations are also being targeted by more cyber-attacks every day and newer security measures are in high demand. One available measure is the application of anomaly detection, which is defined as the discovery of irregular or unusual activity that occurs to a greater or lesser degree than normal occurrences in a data series. In this paper, we continue existing work where various real-world cyber-attacks are executed against a running microservices application, and the application traffic is logged and returned in the form of distributed traces. A Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network is used to model the set of distributed traces and learn the spatial and temporal dependencies of the application traffic. Subsequently, the model is used to make predictions for ongoing microservice activity and threshold-based anomaly detection is applied to detect irregular microservice activity indicating the presence of seeded cyber security attacks, or anomalies. The cyber-attacks used to evaluate this approach include a brute force attack, a batch registration of bot accounts and a distributed denial of service attack. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The current satellite network traffic forecasting methods cannot fully exploit the long correlation between satellite traffic sequences, which leads to large network traffic forecasting errors and low forecasting accuracy. To solve these problems, we propose a satellite network traffic forecasting method with an improved gate recurrent unit (GRU). This method combines the attention mechanism with GRU neural network, fully mines the characteristics of self-similarity and long correlation among traffic data sequences, pays attention to the importance of traffic data and hidden state, learns the time-dependent characteristics of input sequences, and mines the interdependent characteristics of data sequences to improve the prediction accuracy. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to obtain the best network model Hyperparameter and improve the prediction efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed method has the best fitting effect with real traffic data, and the errors are reduced by 26.9%, 37.2%, and 57.8% compared with the GRU, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Fractional Autoregressive Integration Moving Average (FARIMA) models, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Network slicing is one the key features of software-defined networks (SDNs) and can be used in next-generation communication networks. Admission control of network slices is the basis of providing the heterogeneous quality-of-service performance guarantee and maximizing the optimization objectives of the network operator. Various admission control mechanisms have been proposed in the literature, including those based on traffic forecasting. However, recurrent neural network-based probabilistic forecasting models have not been given thorough consideration for slice admission control. In this study, the network slicing scheme design problem is formulated mathematically, with an equivalent formulation of the constrained bandwidth-sharing scheme. Then, a DeepAR-based slice admission control mechanism is proposed for sequential decision making for network slice requests in SDN, with the support of the SDN controller. An improved variant is further proposed with a closed-loop parameter update mechanism. The experiments based on real-world historical traffic data validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms, with metrics, including revenue, resource reservation and utilization ratios, and service admission ratio.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of network function virtualization (NFV), the resource management of service function chains (SFC) in the virtualized environment has gradually become a research hotspot. Usually, users hope that they can get the network services they want anytime and anywhere. The network service requests are dynamic and real-time, which requires that the SFC in the NFV environment can also meet the dynamically changing network service requests. In this regard, this paper proposes an SFC deployment method based on traffic prediction and adaptive virtual network function (VNF) scaling. Firstly, an improved network traffic prediction method is proposed to improve its prediction accuracy for dynamically changing network traffic. Secondly, the predicted traffic data is processed for the subsequent scaling of the VNF. Finally, an adaptive VNF scaling method is designed for the purpose of dynamic management of network virtual resources. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can manage the network resources in dynamic scenarios. It can effectively improve the availability of network services, reduce the operating overhead and achieve a good optimization effect. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Reliable precipitation nowcasting is essential to many fields, which can guide people to reasonably carry out production activities and respond to rainstorm disasters. However, precipitation nowcasting is a very challenging task because of correlation and heterogeneity both in space and in time. Most previous studies have not adequately captured the long-term and long-range spatiotemporal dependencies in the data, leading to insufficient modeling and poor prediction performance. To make more accurate prediction, we propose a novel deep learning model for precipitation nowcasting, called two-stream convolutional LSTM which includes short-term sub-network and long-term sub-network. The two sub-networks, respectively, make predictions on inputs at different time intervals to capture the heterogeneity of rainfall data. On this basis, an innovative recombination module is proposed to fuse the outputs of two sub-networks. In addition, we embed the 3D convolutions and self-attention mechanism to construct a new memory cell, named 3D-SA-LSTM, to extract the spatiotemporal feature. Two-stream convolutional LSTM achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performance on a real-world large-scale dataset and is a more flexible framework that can be conveniently applied to other similarly time series prediction tasks: traffic forecasting and planning, financial analysis and management, actions recognition and prediction, etc. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Integration of the latest technological advancements such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques is an active research area for various industrial applications. The rapid urbanization and exponential growth of vehicles has led to crowded traffic in cities. The deployment of IoT infrastructures for building smart and intelligent traffic management system greatly improves the quality and comfort of city dwellers. This work aims at building a cost effective IoT enabled traffic forecasting system using deep learning techniques. The case study experimentation is done in a real time traffic environment. The main contributions of this work include: (i) deploying road side sensor station built with ultrasonic sensor and Arduino Uno controller for obtaining traffic flow data (ii) building an IoT cloud system based on open source Thingspeak cloud platform for monitoring real time traffic (iii) performing short term traffic forecast using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The performance of the prediction model is compared with the traditional statistical methods such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The results show good performance metrics with RMSE of 5.8, 7.9, 10.2 for LSTM model and 6.7, 8.6, 10.9 for GRU model for three different scenarios such as whole day, morning congested hour and evening congested hour datasets.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

AB  - The great interest in flix-like services has amplified multimedia traffic over the Internet. Recently released traffic forecasting predicts that video-related traffic will be responsible for the majority of Internet traffic by 2022. Such traffic will come in a wide range of duration and in the two modes of live and on-demand. Additionally, it is expected to scale and deliver a smoothed experience to an already fragmented audience. The adaptive bitrate over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has emerged as the top technology for multimedia content transport and delivery. Despite the large amount of work in this area, running streaming applications on overload channels still demands the development of effective strategies. In this work, a video bitrate adaptation mechanism deployed in an overloaded channel of an access network is proposed and evaluated under live and on-demand service modes. This mechanism makes decisions regarding bitrate switching based on the Quality of Experience (QoE)-related parameters to accommodate conflicting variables of its design space, namely, image quality, session continuity and short play time. To evaluate this mechanism, a multifactor QoE metric is proposed based on session parameters such as stalls, startup delay, image quality and the mechanism bitrate misalignment. Moreover, in the numerical studies for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, the average video bitrate, instability and fairness are measured. Overall, the proposed mechanism was able to improve the session QoE for both live and on-demand modes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - NFV realizes flexible and rapid software deployment and management of network functions in the cloud network, and provides network services in the form of chained virtual network functions (VNFs). However, using VNFs to provide quality guaranteed services is still a challenge because of the inherent difficulty in intelligently scaling VNFs to handle traffic fluctuations. Most existing works scale VNFs with fixed-capacity instances, that is they take instances of the same size and determine a suitable deployment location without considering the cloud network resource distribution. This paper proposes a traffic forecasted assisted proactive VNF scaling approach, and it adopts the instance capacity adaptive to the node resource. We first model the VNF scaling as integer quadratic programming and then propose a proactive adaptive VNF scaling (PAVS) approach. The approach employs an efficient traffic forecasting method based on LSTM to predict the upcoming traffic demands. With the obtained traffic demands, we design a resource-aware new VNF instance deployment algorithm to scale out under-provisioning VNFs and a redundant VNF instance management mechanism to scale in over-provisioning VNFs. Trace-driven simulation demonstrates that our proposed approach can respond to traffic fluctuation in advance and reduce the total cost significantly. Copyright © 2022 KSII.

AB  - At present, the amount of network equipment, servers, and network traffic is increasing exponentially, and the way in which operators allocate and efficiently utilize network resources has attracted considerable attention from traffic forecasting researchers. However, with the advent of the 5G era, network traffic has also shown explosive growth, and network complexity has increased dramatically. Accurately predicting network traffic has become a pressing issue that must be addressed. In this paper, a multilayer perceptron ensemble learning method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and gated recurrent units (GRU) spatiotemporal feature extraction (MECG) is proposed for network traffic prediction. First, we extract spatial and temporal features of the data by convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Then, the extracted temporal features and spatial features are fused into new spatiotemporal features through integrated learning of a multilayer perceptron, and a spatiotemporal prediction model is built in the sequence-to-sequence framework. At the same time, the teacher forcing mechanism and attention mechanism are added to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the model. Finally, the proposed method is compared with other deep learning models for experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only has apparent advantages in accuracy but also shows some superiority in time training cost. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Network partitioning is recognized as an effective auxiliary approach for solving transportation tasks on large-scale traffic networks in a domain-decomposition (DD) manner. Most of the existing related partitioning algorithms are explicitly designed to traffic management problems and merely focus on the implied topology of the networks. In this article, toward the practical problems that happened to traffic forecasting (TF) tasks, we propose a network-partitioning-based DD framework to improve graph convolutional network (GCN)-based predictors' performance on large-scale transportation networks. Particularly, we devise a data-driven network-partitioning approach, namely, speed-matching-partitioning (SMP), which employs not only the topological features but also the traffic speed observations of traffic networks for partitioning. Additionally, we propose a data-parallel training strategy that feeds partitioned subnetworks into independent predictors for parallel training. The proposed approach is tested by comprehensive case studies on three real-world data sets to evaluate its effectiveness. The results indicate that the proposed approach can help improve GCN-based predictors' accuracy and training efficiency on both small and relatively large traffic data sets. Furthermore, we investigate the model sensitivity to the selection of graph representations and framework parameters, and the learning efficiency of the data-parallel training strategy.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - For a long time, echo state network (ESN) has been a good application in solving the time series forecasting problem. As an improved ESN, the Self-join Adjacent-feedback Loop Reservoir (SALR) model effectively solves the problem for which ESN is not principled enough and its computational cost is too large. On this basis, this study proposes a novel Gaussian Process Wavelet Self-join Adjacent-feedback Loop Reservoir (GP-WSALR) model. It combines the advantages of SALR and Gaussian process regression, and provides a more reliable alternative than the traditional reservoir calculation model. At the same time, by adjusting the neurons in the reservoir, the problem of poor nonlinear approximation ability and easily fall into singular solutions caused by a single S-type neurons is solved. Specifically, this study proposes to: (1) use Gaussian process regression to replace the classic linear regression method to obtain the output weight of SALR and (2) use wavelet neurons to replace part of the S-type neurons in the GP-SALR reservoir. The novel Gaussian Process Wavelet Self-join Adjacent-feedback Loop Reservoir (GP-WSALR) model is developed by the two new mechanisms. The experimental results show that GP-WSALR obtains superior forecasting accuracy in the electrical load and network traffic forecasting problems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Big data technology is constantly improving, and embedded web systems are gradually improving. Although the wireless network is complex and dense, it also presents the characteristics of flexibility and dynamics. In the first library, people went to the place where they were stored to manually search for the books they needed. Due to the development of technology, the library has a more advanced form-a smart library. Smart libraries use cloud computing and sensors to provide people with a wider range of smart services, which connect books and people. In this article, the author combines big data and embedded web system to analyze the traffic data of the smart library. The model used in this article is a base station traffic prediction model based on time–space analysis. The research area of this model is the area covered by the base station. The relationship between the distribution of the base station's people flow and the transfer of the base station's people flow is studied from the perspective of time and space. In order to find a more reasonable method of predicting the flow of people in the base station, the author comprehensively analyzed the characteristics of the distribution of the flow of people in the base station and the communication characteristics of the flow of people between the base stations. Through practice, it can be found that compared with the traditional budgeting method, this method makes the prediction of human flow more accurate, improves the shortcomings of the traditional prediction method to a large extent, and is helpful to the later network planning. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.

AB  - Despite complex fluctuations, missing data, and maintenance costs of detectors, traffic volume forecasting at intersections is still a challenge. Moreover, most existing forecasting methods consider an isolated intersection instead of multiple adjacent ones. By accurately forecasting the volume of short-term traffic, a low-cost method can be provided to solve the problems of congestion, delay, and breakdown of detectors in the road transport system. This paper outlines a novel hybrid method based on deep learning to estimate short-term traffic volume at three adjacent intersections. The gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) bilayer network with wavelet transform (WL) noise reduction algorithm (WL+GRU-LSTM) are used to analyze raw traffic volume data. The WL+GRU-LSTM is constructed by comparing different machine learning and deep learning methods. A comparative study was used to choose the model’s network structure, training technique, and optimizer type. To prove the model’s accuracy and resilience, it was compared with the leading short-term traffic forecasting approaches. Experimental results confirm that the WL+GRU-LSTM model can forecast complex traffic volume fluctuations in different approaches of intersections with an accuracy of over 94%. It also shows better results compared to current methods. The proposed model could replace intermediate loop detectors. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Efficient and accurate prediction of traffic state plays a major role in the implementation of effective intelligent transportation systems. Therefore, traffic forecasting has been attracting a significant interest over the last decades striving to efficiently achieve highest accuracy of reliable prediction algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel prediction algorithm based on the Conditionally Gaussian Observed Markov Fuzzy Switching Model (CGOMFSM). The proposed scheme relies on a triplet representation of traffic encompassing traffic flow, speed and a switch process in order to infer parameters that govern the dynamics of traffic. This work investigates the impact of explicit incorporation of fuzzy switching processes on the accuracy of traffic data prediction. It aims to overcome the shortcomings of several existing prediction schemes in which the crisp modeling of traffic dynamics is hindering the effectiveness of prediction. The experimental study shows that the proposed algorithm yields satisfactory results for a prediction horizon up to 60 minutes for data collected at regular 15-minutes intervals. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Deep learning-based traffic forecasting methods can capture intricate spatiotemporal features in traffic data and environmental factors. However, they have unsatisfactory performance around the minority peaks and are inefficient for modeling wide-range spatial correlations. This article gives a peak-aware deep learning architecture for traffic forecasting by involving a cost-sensitive loss function called peak-sensitive loss. This method can improve the performance since different costs are employed on the prevalent metrics such as mean-square loss and square of mean absolute percentage loss. A spatiotemporal convolutional architecture based on a dilated convolutional network (DCN) and a temporal convolutional network (TCN) is constructed that models the spatial features (both wide and short range) by the DCN and learns the time characteristics by the TCN. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated with real-world data sets.  © 2009-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting has attracted considerable attention due to its importance in proactive urban traffic control and management. Scholars and engineers have exerted considerable efforts in improving the performance of traffic forecasting algorithms in terms of accuracy, reliability, and efficiency. Spatial feature representation of traffic flow is a core component that greatly influences traffic forecasting performance. In previous studies, several spatial attributes of traffic flow are ignored due to the following issues: a) traffic flow propagation does not comply with the road network, b) the spatial pattern of traffic flow varies over time, and c) single adjacent matrix cannot handle the complex and hierarchical urban traffic flow. To address the abovementioned issues, this study proposes a novel traffic forecasting algorithm called traffic transformer, which achieves great success in natural language processing. The multihead attention mechanism and stacking layers enable the transformer to learn dynamic and hierarchical features in sequential data. Two components, namely, global encoder and global-local decoder, are proposed to extract and fuse the spatial patterns globally and locally. Experimental results indicate that the proposed traffic transformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The learned dynamic and hierarchical features of traffic flow can help achieve a better understanding of spatial dependency of traffic flow for effective and efficient traffic control and management strategies.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, spatial–temporal graph modeling based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) has become an effective method for mining spatial–temporal dependencies in traffic forecasting research. However, existing studies lack the capability of dynamic spatial–temporal modeling of traffic speeds. Furthermore, long-term forecasting is difficult because of the diversity of traffic conditions. In addition, traditional studies capture only the features of fixed graph structures, which do not reflect real spatial dependence. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel attention-based dynamic spatial–temporal graph convolutional network (ADSTGCN) model. ADSTGCN mainly consists of multiple dynamic spatial–temporal blocks, each of which contains three modules: 1) a dynamic adjustment module to model the dynamic spatial–temporal correlations of traffic speed, 2) a gated dilated convolution module to mine long-term dependencies, and 3) a spatial convolution module to capture hidden spatial dependencies. Experiments on three public traffic datasets demonstrated the good performance of the model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a classical spatial-temporal data prediction problem with extensive applications, such as dynamic traffic management, route planning and traffic congestion alleviation. However, accurate traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex correlations of traffic data. Few approaches are satisfied with both long-term and short-term prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Convolutional Networks (MSCN), an end-to-end solution to solve traffic forecasting problem. MSCN first employs an encoder with spatial-temporal attention mechanism to model both spatial and temporal correlations. Then, the decoder utilizes multiple convolutions and form groups of units to extract spatial-temporal features for different resolutions. In particular, we propose a soft thresholding fusion mechanism to adaptively adjust the conditions of spatial and temporal correlations. Experiments on two real traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSCN obtains improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forecasting traffic flow and speed in the urban is important for many applications, ranging from the intelligent navigation of map applications to congestion relief of city management systems. Therefore, mining the complex spatio-temporal correlations in the traffic data to accurately predict traffic is essential for the community. However, previous studies that combined the graph convolution network or self-attention mechanism with deep time series models (e.g., the recurrent neural network) can only capture spatial dependencies in each time slot and temporal dependencies in each sensor, ignoring the spatial and temporal correlations across different time slots and sensors. Besides, the state-of-the-art Transformer architecture used in previous methods is insensitive to local spatio-temporal contexts, which is hard to suit with traffic forecasting. To solve the above two issues, we propose a novel deep learning model for traffic forecasting, named Locality-aware spatio-temporal joint Transformer (Lastjormer), which elaborately designs a spatio-temporal joint attention in the Transformer architecture to capture all dynamic dependencies in the traffic data. Specifically, our model utilizes the dot-product self-attention on sensors across many time slots to extract correlations among them and introduces the linear and convolution self-attention mechanism to reduce the computation needs and incorporate local spatio-temporal information. Experiments on three real-world traffic datasets, England, METR-LA, and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate that our Lastjormer achieves state-of-the-art performances on a variety of challenging traffic forecasting benchmarks.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Recurring congestion on highways is the primary cause of traffic congestion in the urban traffic system while jams on merging sections are the worst section along the expressway. Due to the presence of heavy congestion in the site of University of Technology, this study aims to discover the traffic characteristics of this site to determine the appropriate solutions. Therefore, this study selects a merging section on Mohammed Al-Qassim expressway to investigate some characteristics of such a section in Iraq. Field data have been collected from this site for 4 h. The data were collected from video cameras installed along the expressway in Baghdad city which is called Mohammed Al-Qassim Expressway. These data present flow of upstream and ramp. The Advanced Interactive Microscopic Simulator for Urban and Non-Urban Networks (AIMSUN) program was also adopted to investigate other characteristics which are difficult to get such as speed and occupancy for the current case. The results showed that the simulated and real data significantly corresponded. In this study, the AIMSUN program received recognition by utilizing Geoffrey E. Havers a method for comparing two sets of traffic volumes that are used in traffic engineering, traffic forecasting, and traffic modeling as it was discovered to be comparable to reality, and the road management was then enhanced by the addition of ramp metering and cycle (green) time control.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

AB  - Uncertainty quantification is important for making reliable decisions in transportation planning and operations. In the field of short-term traffic condition forecasting, uncertainty quantification methods include primarily distribution-based approaches and nondistribution-based approaches. For the former, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model has been widely applied to model and quantify traffic condition uncertainty in terms of prediction interval under normality assumption. However, this normality assumption has not been systematically investigated yet. Therefore, this paper attempts to investigate this normality assumption and thereby quantify traffic condition uncertainty, using a method with steps of residual calculation and investigation, normality investigation, distribution estimation, uncertainty quantification, and performance measurement. Using real-world traffic flow data, the distributions of the selected samples are shown to be nonnormal using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and normal probability plot. Distribution estimation using nonnormal models shows that the t location-scale distribution and generalized error distribution (GED) can be used to model traffic condition uncertainty. Uncertainty quantification using GARCH under these nonnormal distributions further show that nonnormal models outperform the normal model, with the GARCH model under t location-scale distribution yielding the best performance. Future studies are recommended to promote the investigation into traffic condition uncertainty quantification and application.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting plays a critical role in the construction of intelligent transportation systems. However, due to the across road-network isomorphism in the spatial dimension and the periodic drift in the temporal dimension, existing traffic forecasting methods cannot satisfy the intricate spatial-temporal characteristics well. In this article, a spatial-temporal hypergraph convolutional network for traffic forecasting (ST-HCN) is proposed to tackle the problems mentioned above. Specifically, the proposed framework applies the K-means clustering algorithm and the connection characteristics of the physical road network itself to unify the local correlation and across road-network isomorphism. Then, a dual-channel hypergraph convolution to capture high-order spatial relationships in traffic data is established. Furthermore, the proposed framework utilizes a long short-term memory network with a convolution module (ConvLSTM) to deal with the periodic drift problem. Finally, the experiments in the real world demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of the-art baselines. © 2023 Zhao et al

AB  - Extensive traffic flow data are received from the loop detector networks every second, which requires us to develop an effective and efficient algorithm to predict future traffic flow. However, dynamic traffic conditions on a road are not just influenced by sequential patterns in the temporal dimension, but also by other roadways in the spatial dimension. Although many successful models have been developed in previous studies to forecast future traffic flows, most of them have shortcomings in modeling spatial and temporal dependencies. In this article, we focus on spatial-temporal factors and propose a new adaptive spatial-temporal transformer graph network (ASTTGN) to improve the accuracy of traffic forecasting by jointly modeling the spatial-temporal information of road networks. Specifically, we propose an adaptive spatial-temporal transformer module, which contains two developed adaptive transformer modules for capturing dynamic spatial dependence and temporal dependence across multiple time steps, respectively. Finally, feature fusion is performed through a gated feature aggregation layer to simulate the effect of complex spatial-temporal factors on traffic conditions. In particular, the multihead attention mechanism employed by the transformer can effectively explore the potential spatial-temporal dependence patterns in different subspaces. Experimental results on two real-world traffic data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model compared to existing techniques.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The traffic forecasting problem is a challenging task that requires spatial-Temporal modeling and gathers research interests from various domains. In recent years, spatial-Temporal deep learning models have improved the accuracy and scale of traffic forecasting. While hundreds of models have been suggested, they share similar modules, or building blocks, which can be categorized into three temporal feature extraction methods of recurrent neural networks, convolution, and self-Attention and two spatial feature extraction methods of convolutional graph neural networks (GNN) and attentional GNN. More importantly, the models have been mostly evaluated for their entire architectures with limited efforts to characterize and understand the performance of each category of building blocks. In this study, we conduct an extensive, multi-faceted experiment to understand the influence of building block selection on traffic forecasting accuracy, considering environmental characteristics and dataset distributions. Specifically, we implement six traffic forecasting models using three temporal and two spatial building blocks. When we evaluate the models on four datasets with diverse characteristics, the results show each building block demonstrates distinguishable characteristics depending on study sites, prediction horizons, and traffic categories. The convolution models demonstrate higher overall forecasting performance than other models, whereas self-Attention models show competitiveness in less frequent traffic categories, transition states, and the presence of outliers. Based on the results, we also suggest an adaptive model evaluation framework for category-wise predictions of test sets based on the performance of the models on validation sets. The results of this evaluation framework demonstrate improved forecasting accuracy at most by 3.7% without further sophistication in existing model architectures. The results enhance the utility of existing models and suggest guidelines for researchers building traffic forecasting model architectures and for practitioners implementing these state-of-The-Art techniques in real-world applications.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Long-term insight into maritime traffic is critical for port authorities, logistics companies, and port operators to proactively formulate suitable policies, develop strategic plans, allocate budget, and preserve and improve competitiveness. Forecasting freight rate is a spotlight in port traffic literature, but relatively little research has been directed at forecasting long-term vessel traffic trends. Based on forecast long-term freight rate input provided by the recent 10-year strategic planning of the port of Rajaee, the largest port of Iran, the paper implements seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and neural network (NN) models to forecast its container vessel traffic between 2020 and 2025. A database consisting of monthly container traffic data for this port from 1999 to 2019 is utilized. The comparison between the two forecasting models is fulfilled by benchmarking the naïve method. The results reveal the superiority of the NN model over SARIMA in this practice. Considering NN model outputs, the port should expect a significant increase in Panamax and Over-Panamax vessels in the future, and, if not timely addressed, this would result in a systemic queue in the port of Rajaee. That said, the approach can be implemented in port planning and design to avoid under-or over-estimations in such capital-intensive projects. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2022.

AB  - To better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and reduce unbalanced errors in short-term traffic prediction, an advanced Bayesian combination model with graph neural network (ABCM-GNN) is proposed. A new ABCM framework involving an error correction mechanism is established, based on the analysis of distance correlation between historical and current traffic volumes. Two sub-predictors built, respectively, on the graph attention gated recurrent unit (GAGRU) network, which captures the spatial correlation of road network, and autoregressive integrated moving average method (ARIMA), are incorporated into the ABCM framework to enhance the strength and capability of the framework. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model are demonstrated in various scenarios with experiments conducted using real-time traffic data collected on the California freeway. The overall results show that the ABCM-GNN with ARIMA method is superior to state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and stability.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is an important part in realising intelligent traffic management, which helps traffic controllers and travellers make effective decisions. However, traffic forecasting accuracy is often affected by missing traffic data due to hardware and software failure. Therefore, accurate prediction based on incomplete traffic data is an important problem as well as a challenge. Though many approaches recover the missing values before prediction, the errors from the data-filling step are likely to cause additional bias to the prediction result. Besides, this tactic is difficult to guarantee the timeliness and may impede real-time prediction. In this case, a traffic forecasting model is proposed to directly predict traffic data with missing values. This model develops tensor formed dynamic mode decomposition, recording the dynamic information of traffic data into a state transition tensor. In addition, the model takes low rank property of the dynamic tensor and the similarity of temporal variation trend into consideration. In order to verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed model, experiments were performed on two real-world time series datasets. The results demonstrate that the model achieves better performance on forecasting than other baseline approaches under the impact of missing data. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Modeling complex spatial and temporal dependencies in multivariate time series data is crucial for traffic forecasting. Graph convolutional networks have proved to be effective in predicting multivariate time series. Although a predefined graph structure can help the model converge to good results quickly, it also limits the further improvement of the model due to its stationary state. In addition, current methods may not converge on some datasets due to the graph structure of these datasets being difficult to learn. Motivated by this, we propose a novel model named Dynamic Correlation Graph Convolutional Network (DCGCN) in this paper. The model can construct adjacency matrices from input data using a correlation coefficient; thus, dynamic correlation graph convolution is used for capturing spatial dependencies. Meanwhile, gated temporal convolution is used for modeling temporal dependencies. Finally, we performed extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed method against ten existing well-recognized baseline methods using two original and four public datasets. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This paper elaborates on forecasts in the road traffic and freight flows in the urban–port transport system to quantify the effects of the freight traffic performance considering road capacity expansion in a port city in Poland. The urban–port transport system was broken down into a subsystem of roads that lead directly to the port transshipment areas and a subsystem of urban roads with mixed freight and passenger traffic. The research resulted in an elaborated long-term forecast of freight and traffic flows in the porttransshipmenturban road system. Also, the impact of capacity improvements in the local transport system on port-related freight traffic performance was quantified using an incremental calculus for transport performance for two options: with and without road capacity expansion. As investigated, an intervention will lead to a reduction in time of freight traffic trips, freight transports, and drivers working time as well as to decreased emissions of CO2. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Today, traffic is one of the biggest problems of urban management. There are two general methods for traffic management, soft and hard methods. In the hard method, physical changes are applied to the road network, and in the soft method, the existing conditions are optimized. Traffic forecasting is one of the soft methods for traffic management. Traffic forecasting is usually done based on the time of existing traffic conditions, while the effect of location and neighborhood, which is one of the concepts of GIS science, is less seen in predictions. In this research, variables affecting traffic were first identified. Then, five machine learning methods were used to predict traffic on all city roads. KNN method was selected as the best one with accuracy and Kappa of 96.14% and 0.95 respectively. Finally, the prediction map was prepared by applying the superior model and Geographic Information System (GIS). One of the advantages of the traffic prediction map is easy for users and administrators to manage traffic. © 2023, Pouyan Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is an integral part of modern intelligent transportation systems. Although many techniques have been proposed in the literature to address the problem, most of them focus almost exclusively on forecasting accuracy and ignore other important aspects of the problem. In the paper at hand, a new method for both accurate and fast large-scale traffic forecasting, named “sparse feature regression”, is presented. Initially, a set of carefully selected features is extracted from the available traffic data. Then, some of the initial features are sparsified, namely they are transformed into sets of sparse features. Finally, a linear regression model is designed using the sparse feature set, which is trained by solving an optimization problem using a sparse approximate pseudoinverse as a preconditioner. We evaluated the proposed method by conducting experiments on two real-world traffic datasets, and the experimental results showed that the method presents the best balance between accuracy of predictions and time required for achieving them, in comparison with a set of benchmark models. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - This paper surveys the short-term road traffic forecast algorithms based on the long-short term memory (LSTM) model of deep learning. The algorithms developed in the last three years are studied and analyzed. This provides an in-depth and thorough description of the algorithms rather than their marginal description as performed in the existing surveys that focus on general deep learning algorithms. The chosen algorithms are classified depending upon the use of LSTM in combination with other techniques for processing input data features towards a final traffic forecast. The operational strategies of the algorithms are described with merits and limitations. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the compared classes of algorithms is also provided. These strategies are helpful in selection of the right algorithms and their classes for the diverse traffic conditions and their future investigation for improvement. Besides, the applications of these classes of algorithms to traffic forecast in various networks for the latest decade is graphically depicted. Moreover, the applications of the LSTM in other fields involving a forecast are provided. Finally, the challenges associated with the short-term traffic forecast using the LSTM are described and strategies are highlighted for their future investigation.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The efficient automated network management methods for mobile operators (for example, mobile traffic prediction) are important goals for future mobile networks. Nevertheless, accurately predicting mobile traffic across an entire city is a challenge that requires the consideration of both prediction accuracy and computational complexity, especially in terms of the thousands of regions involved in high-density and complex base station deployment scenarios for 5G/beyond 5G/6G networks. To solve this problem, this study proposed a novel deep learning network based on the transformer, i.e., a spatial-temporal downsampling neural network (STD-Net), which can dynamically and simultaneously exploit the temporal, local, and global spatial dependencies of mobile traffic. To reduce the computational complexity in spatial domains and achieve a balance between generalization (for all regions) and fitness (for each region), the model decomposes a city into patches and focuses on simultaneously exploiting the temporal and local spatial dependencies in each patch via spatial-temporal transformers. This study's downsampling transformer is responsible for exploiting global spatial dependencies by uniformly sampling mobile traffic throughout all the regions of an entire city. Computing spatial correlations among sampled regions reduces the computational complexity even further. The superior prediction accuracy of the proposed STD-Net model over state-of-the-art baselines was confirmed by experiments on real-world mobile traffic datasets. The effectiveness of each module was tested to further validate the rationale and feasibility of the proposed STD-Net. Analyses of the computational complexity of the STD-Net revealed that its computational cost contains the same quadratic complexity as vanilla transformers. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Network traffic prediction based on probe vehicle data is important for traffic management and route recommendation and has been intensively studied. Previous traffic prediction methods mainly focused on recurring traffic congestion. Predicting non-recurring traffic congestion, caused by events and accidents, is significantly more important; however, it has not been intensively studied. To predict non-recurring traffic congestion using probe data, we need to estimate the current traffic conditions based on sparse observations for large traffic networks to track traffic changes online. Conventional traffic forecasting methods have not been able to solve all of these problems. To address these problems, we propose a data assimilation method using a state space neural network (SSNN) with an incorporated topology of road networks. The SSNN model can easily model network traffic and can easily estimate its states and parameters by data assimilation using Bayesian filtering. In this study, we adopted a decoupled extended Kalman filter (DEKF) based data assimilation, which is scalable and applicable to large-scale network traffic, to estimate the states and parameters online. We evaluate the proposed method using an open dataset that includes a road network comprising over 30000 road segments. The results show that our method achieves higher prediction accuracy for predicting unknown traffic congestion and is more robust against data sparsity than conventional state estimation methods. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - With the steadily growing traffic demand, urban traffic congestion is becoming a critical issue threatening several factors, including public safety, emissions of greenhouse gas, and transport inefficiencies. Thus, intelligent transport systems (ITS) have emerged as a promising solution to easing the burden of congestion. ITS rely on different technologies such as VANET (Vehicular Adhoc Networks) which provide the transportation system with ubiquitous connectivity allowing the exchange of traffic information between vehicles and roadside terminals. This can support numerous smart mobility applications such as traffic signal control and real-time traffic management. Hence, mobility models were developed to emulate and forecast the distribution of traffic which will be helpful to the design and management of traffic control strategies. In this context, this study specifically concentrates on developing a mobility model that reflects vehicular activities in urban environments based on vehicular information collected using vehicular communications. The behavior of vehicles along multi-lane roads and intersections is modeled as a stochastic process using queuing theory. Particularly, the queue system is analyzed as a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and by calculating the steady-state probabilities, different performance measures are derived and analyzed under various scenarios. To validate the model, the obtained forecasts are compared with a queue model and realistic traces. The results show that the model is capable of reproducing the realistic behavior of traffic in urban roads without incurring heavy costs and time-consuming computing. The obtained estimates were then used to design an actuated traffic light and a vehicle speed adaptor. From the simulation results, it is clear that using the proposed traffic forecasting model helps reduce vehicles idling and travel times. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The task of reducing the time for the purchase of essential goods is especially relevant in cases of shortage of free time of buyers. To do this, it is necessary to predict and estimate the time required to purchase goods. Traditional approaches based on cartographic systems do not provide estimates and forecasts, but only allow you to build a route to the right place based on an assessment of the traffic situation. For this reason, the problem of developing a more modern model is relevant, taking into account such factors as the infrastructural location of the store, user evaluation, and the workload of the store. The paper proposes an information model that includes such time costs of the buyer as the search for goods, the route to the place of sale of goods, the purchase of goods. The time spent on the purchase of goods is described using elements of queuing theory. Statistical and direct methods for assessing the workload and queues in the store are highlighted. The developed generalized model contains the parameters necessary to estimate the required time using statistical methods which include traffic forecasting based on user ratings and reviews, analysis of the infrastructure location and public video surveillance cameras, public Application Programming Interface of stores, and Internet services. Correction coefficients have been introduced to adjust the estimation of model parameters depending on the infrastructure location of the store and user ratings. A new information model has been formulated that allows taking into account the dependence of the time required to purchase emergency goods on the workload of the store, its infrastructure location, ratings and user reviews. The simulation model is developed in the AnyLogic environment. An example of using the model to estimate the average time spent on the purchase of emergency goods is demonstrated. The simulation results are consistent with the conducted experiment in which purchases of emergency goods were made in various stores in Saint Petersburg. The developed model can be used when searching for the optimal route to the place of sale of essential goods when planning the construction of stores as well as in the areas of marketing and delivery of goods. © ITMO University.

AB  - Traffic volatility modeling has been highly valued in recent years because of its advantages in describing the uncertainty of traffic flow during the short-term forecasting process. A few generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) models have been developed to capture and hence forecast the volatility of traffic flow. Although these models have been confirmed to be capable of producing more reliable forecasts than traditional point forecasting models, the more or less imposed restrictions on parameter estimations may make the asymmetric property of traffic volatility be not or insufficiently considered. Furthermore, the performance of the models has not been fully evaluated and compared in the traffic forecasting context, rendering the choice of the models dilemmatic for traffic volatility modeling. In this study, an omnibus traffic volatility forecasting framework is proposed, where various traffic volatility models with symmetric and asymmetric properties can be developed in a unifying way by fixing or flexibly estimating three key parameters, namely the Box-Cox transformation coefficient (Formula presented.), the shift factor (Formula presented.), and the rotation factor (Formula presented.). Extensive traffic speed datasets collected from urban roads of Kunshan city, China, and from freeway segments of the San Diego Region, USA, were used to evaluate the proposed framework and develop traffic volatility forecasting models in a number of case studies. The models include the standard GARCH, the threshold GARCH (TGARCH), the nonlinear ARCH (NGARCH), the nonlinear-asymmetric GARCH (NAGARCH), the Glosten–Jagannathan–Runkle GARCH (GJR-GARCH), and the family GARCH (FGARCH). The mean forecasting performance of the models was measured with mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), while the volatility forecasting performance of the models was measured with volatility mean absolute error (VMAE), directional accuracy (DA), kickoff percentage (KP), and average confidence length (ACL). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework and provide insights into how to develop and select proper traffic volatility forecasting models in different situations. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - With the evaluation of cellular network internet data traffic, forecasting and understanding traffic patterns become the critical objectives for managing the network-designed Quality of Service (QoS) benchmark. For this purpose, cellular network planners often use different methodologies for predicting data traffic. However, traditional traffic forecasting approaches are erroneous. As well as most of the time, traditional traffic forecasts are high-level or a generously large regional cluster level. Also, eNodeB-level utilization concerning with traffic forecasting is not readily available. As a result, user experience degradation or unnecessary network expansion is triggered based on the traditional method. This research focuses on extensive 6.2 million real network time series Long-Term Evolution (LTE) data traffic and other associate parameters, including eNodeB-wise Physical Resource Block (PRB) utilization, which mainly focuses on building a traffic forecasting model with the help of multivariate feature inputs and deep learning algorithms. A state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithm-based fusion model is proposed. The combination of different deep learning algorithms, namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), enables traffic forecasting at a granular eNodeB-level and also provides eNodeB-wise forecasted PRB utilization. In this research R2 score value for the proposed fusion model is 0.8034, which outperforms traditional models. Apart from the PRB utilization, QoS threshold was devised as 70% from a real network experience to trigger soft parameter tuning decisions. Based on the forecasted PRB utilization, this research proposed a unique algorithm that estimates eNodeB-level soft capacity parameter optimization for a short-term step-up solution or long-term network expansion to ensure a guaranteed QoS benchmark.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - While considering the spatial and temporal features of traffic, capturing the impacts of various external factors on travel is an essential step towards achieving accurate traffic forecasting. However, existing studies seldom consider external factors or neglect the effect of the complex correlations among external factors on traffic. Intuitively, knowledge graphs can naturally describe these correlations. Since knowledge graphs and traffic networks are essentially heterogeneous networks, it is challenging to integrate the information in both networks. On this background, this study presents a knowledge representation-driven traffic forecasting method based on spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks. We first construct a knowledge graph for traffic forecasting and derive knowledge representations by a knowledge representation learning method named KR-EAR. Then, we propose the Knowledge Fusion Cell (KF-Cell) to combine the knowledge and traffic features as the input of a spatial-temporal graph convolutional backbone network. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our strategy enhances the forecasting performances of backbones at various prediction horizons. The ablation and perturbation analysis further verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that constructs and utilizes a knowledge graph to facilitate traffic forecasting; it also offers a promising direction to integrate external information and spatial-temporal information for traffic forecasting.

AB  - The digital growth has triggered explosion of mobile and wireless scenario. This expansion propelled the high demand of wireless capacity especially bandwidth. The increased demand lead to the need of efficient utilization of critical resources in networks. Under such circumstances, software defined mobile network (SDMN) controller has emerged as one of the promising solution for efficient management of resources. As the data flow is not constant throughout, so is the resource requirement. The mobile traffic forecasting helps SDMN controller to allocate resources according to the fluctuating demand of traffic peaks or troughs. Different forecasting algorithms already exist to identify the solution but most of them fail to achieve the global optimum value. This paper motivates to make SDMN mobile network more reliable, congestion free and intelligent decision maker by introducing an intelligent whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) to identify optimal parameters of the forecasting model. The accuracy of the proposed model will improve network efficiency because of dynamic decisions based on forecasting results. The WOA offers slow rate of convergence along iterative process and tends to converge into local optimum. The proposed algorithm is predominantly using chaotic maps, weight factor and convergence factor to estimate and naturally adjust the intrinsic parameters of optimization. Along the iterative cycles, the proposed technique (IWOA) emend the effectiveness of search to reach towards the optimal solution. To illuminate the efficiency of the IWOA in forecasting model, it is compared over two different scenarios of datasets. Additionally, the results show the improved performance of the proposed IWOA in terms of sensitivity (0.02%), accuracy (3.57%), precision (0.05%) and F1-Score (0.04%) with regard to WOA. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An intelligent transport system (ITS) is fully valuable only if it can dynamically and aptly integrate all the latest cutting-edge technologies. An ITS focuses on providing services like promptly offering real-time road traffic information to interested parties, finding ways to reduce the average waiting time and offer secure and reliable services for commuters using past statistics. Short-term traffic prediction is one such area in which the research community has focused in the past decade. Existing models developed for prediction has scope to improve in terms of accuracy and training time. There is a necessity to develop a best-performing model that is computationally affluent to train with the optimal hyperparameter configuration as input which leads to improved performance. This article proposes a model that captures the traffic flow trend present in the past data to predict the flow for a future time interval. This model is an amalgamation of seasonal global trend (SGT) model and long short-term memory (LSTM) model with attention mechanism. A novel hyperparameter tuning algorithm is also proposed which is based on multi-armed bandit strategy with context, incorporating the right trade-off between exploitation and exploration of the hyperparameter space using successive halving. Experimental results conducted proves that our forecast model in combination with the proposed hyperparameter tuning algorithm outperforms the existing models like SGT, LSTM models in terms of accuracy and time. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In recent years, traffic forecasting has gradually attracted attention in data mining because of the increasing availability of large-scale traffic data. However, it faces substantial challenges of complex temporal-spatial correlations in traffic. Recent studies mainly focus on modeling the local spatial correlations by utilizing graph neural networks and neglect the influence of long-distance spatial correlations. Besides, most existing works utilize recurrent neural networks-based encoder–decoder architecture to forecast multistep traffic volume and suffer from accumulative errors in recurrent neural networks. To deal with these issues, we propose the memory attention (MA) enhanced graph convolution long short-term memory network (MAEGCLSTM), a novel deep learning model for traffic forecasting. Specifically, MAEGCLSTM combines the MA and the vanilla graph convolution long short-term memory to capture global and local spatio-temporal dependencies, respectively. Then MAEGCLSTM utilizes a simplified GCLSTM to effectively fuse the global and local information. Moreover, we integrate the MAEGCLSTM into an encoder–decoder architecture to forecast multistep traffic volume. Besides MAEGCLSTM, we add the convolution neural network and encoder–decoder attention into the decoder to ease accumulative errors caused by iterative prediction and gain whole historical information from the encoder. Experiments on four real-world traffic data sets show that our model significantly outperforms by up to (Formula presented.) improvement in (Formula presented.) measure over 14 baselines. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Travel time forecasting has become a core component of smart transportation systems, which assists both travelers and traffic organizers with route planning, travel schedule adjustments, ride-sharing, navigation applications, and efficient traffic management. However, timely and accurate travel time forecasting still remains a critical challenge owing to the complex nonlinear and dynamic fluctuations of spatial–temporal dependencies. Also, spatial sparseness is a big issue in traffic forecasting, since adopting the implicit interactions between the close traffic regions leads to superficial characterization of spatio-temporal dependences. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based framework (STTG-TTE) that addresses these drawbacks and improves the travel time estimation. First, we build a geo-hashing algorithm for the data sparsity issue that incorporates fluctuations of nearby and distant traffic situations in terms of spatio-temporal dependencies. Second, a new spatio-temporal correlation modeling method is proposed to fully leverage large-scale spatial and temporal traffic patterns using temporal convolutional networks integrated with a gated multi-modality mechanism. Then, for external factors’ representation, a new dual-gated Res-Net multi-modality-based module is proposed. Finally, we fuse these representations of multi-components dynamically and utilize the transformer model, which is conducive to learning intersections among these multiple factors for obtaining accurate prediction results. Experiments on two large-scale real-world traffic datasets from two different urban regions (Chengdu taxi-datsets and NYC-Bike datasets) demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to state-of-the-art baseline models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The value of freight travel time savings (VFTTS) is a monetary value that is considered an important input into cost–benefit analysis and traffic forecasting. The VFTTS is defined as the marginal rate of substitution between travel time and cost and may therefore differ across firms, time and countries. The paper aims to explain variations in the VFTTS by using the meta-analysis method. The analysis covers 106 monetary valuations extracted from 56 studies conducted from 1988 to 2018 in countries across the globe. The meta-analysis method determines the factors that have an impact on these VFTTS variations. The paper briefly introduces the VFTTS concept and describes the adopted meta-analysis methodology, wherein different meta-models are used in VFTTS estimations. The results highlight the necessity of including multiple explanatory variables to ensure adequate explanation of the VFTTS variations. The findings also show that GDP per capita, transport mode and type of survey respondent are statistically significant variables. The paper sheds some light on the variations, thereby advancing the understanding of each factor’s effects on the VFTTS. Furthermore, meta-model outcomes are used to generate new values of travel time savings for different transport modes in freight transport, for several countries. These implied VFTTS can be used as benchmarks to assess existing evidence or provide new evidence to countries where no such values exist. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In fifth generation (5G), traffic forecasting is one of the target areas for research to offer better service to the users. In order to enhance the services, researchers have provided deep learning models to predict the normal traffic, but these suggested models are failing to predict the traffic load during the festivals time due to sudden changes in traffic conditions. In order to address this issue, a hybrid model is proposed which is the combination of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), called as ARIMA-CNN-LSTM, where we forecast the cumulative network traffic over specific intervals to scale up and correctly predict the availability of 5G network resources. In the comparative analysis, the ARIMA-CNN-LSTM is evaluated with well-known existing models, namely, ARIMA, CNN and LSTM. It is observed that the proposed model outperforms the other tested deep learning models in predicting the output in both usual and unusual traffic conditions.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Accurate spatio-temporal traffic forecasting serves as the basis of dynamic strategy and applications for intelligent transportation systems, which is of great practical significance for improving traffic safety and mitigating road congestion. Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been applied to traffic flow forecasting, which exhibits better performance than conventional methods. However, these CNN-based methods typically learn traffic as images to model spatial correlation, which is only applicable to Euclidean grid map data rather than non-Euclidean multi-sensor data. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based temporal attention framework GTA, which considers both spatial and temporal correlation, to forecast traffic flow based on data collected from multiple sensors. More specifically, GTA can better capture spatial dependencies leveraging graph embedding techniques on sensor networks because it preserves more details in the algorithms. We also introduce an attention mechanism to adaptively identify the relations among temporal submodules. Spatio-temporal dependencies are more effectively and comprehensively integrated due to the full use of the topological properties of transportation networks. We evaluate GTA with a large-scale traffic dataset from England and enhance it with topology information. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Dot-product attention is a powerful mechanism for capturing contextual information. Models that build on top of it have acclaimed state-of-the-art performance in various domains, ranging from sequence modelling to visual tasks. However, the main bottleneck is the construction of the attention map, which is quadratic with respect to the number of tokens in the sequence. Consequently, efficient alternatives have been developed in parallel, but it was only recently that their performances were compared and contrasted. This study performs a comparative analysis between some efficient attention mechanisms in the context of a purely attention-based spatio-temporal forecasting model used for traffic prediction. Experiments show that these methods can reduce the training times by up to 28% and the inference times by up to 31%, while the performance remains on par with the baseline. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the highly non-linear nature of traffic data and the complex structure of road networks, traffic forecasting faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose an improved model that combines outlook attention and graph embedding (MOAGE) for traffic forecasting, focusing on the construction of reasonable and effective spatio-temporal dependencies. Inspired by the idea of symmetry, MOAGE adopts a symmetrical encoder and decoder structure. Outlook attention blocks are important components of the encoder and decoder, consisting of spatial outlook attention and temporal outlook attention, used to model spatio-temporal dependencies in the road network. Cross attention are added to the model to reduce propagation errors. In addition, we learned the vertex representation of the graph via the node2vec algorithm and integrated the graph information into our model for a better prediction performance. Extensive experiments on two real datasets further demonstrate that the RMSE errors of the MOAGE on PEMS_BAY and METR_LA are reduced by approximately 14.6% and 12.2% for 60 min compared with the latest baseline models. Finally, the methodology used in this study will provide guidance to relevant ministries to better allocate transport resources and improve the efficiency and safety of traffic operations. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Deep Learning methods have been proven to be flexible to model complex phenomena. This has also been the case of Intelligent Transportation Systems, in which several areas such as vehicular perception and traffic analysis have widely embraced Deep Learning as a core modeling technology. Particularly in short-term traffic forecasting, the capability of Deep Learning to deliver good results has generated a prevalent inertia towards using Deep Learning models, without examining in depth their benefits and downsides. This paper focuses on critically analyzing the state of the art in what refers to the use of Deep Learning for this particular Intelligent Transportation Systems research area. To this end, we elaborate on the findings distilled from a review of publications from recent years, based on two taxonomic criteria. A posterior critical analysis is held to formulate questions and trigger a necessary debate about the issues of Deep Learning for traffic forecasting. The study is completed with a benchmark of diverse short-term traffic forecasting methods over traffic datasets of different nature, aimed to cover a wide spectrum of possible scenarios. Our experimentation reveals that Deep Learning could not be the best modeling technique for every case, which unveils some caveats unconsidered to date that should be addressed by the community in prospective studies. These insights reveal new challenges and research opportunities in road traffic forecasting, which are enumerated and discussed thoroughly, with the intention of inspiring and guiding future research efforts in this field.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the great success of graph convolutional networks in short-term traffic forecasting (e.g., 15-30 min ahead) tasks by capturing dependencies in road network structure. Based on these models, long-term forecasting can be achieved by two approaches: (1) recursively generating a one-step-ahead prediction and (2) adapting the models to sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning. However, in practice, these two approaches often show poor performance in long-term forecasting tasks. The recursive approach suffers from the error accumulation problem, as the model is trained based on one-step-ahead loss. On the other hand, seq2seq shows convergence issues that limit its application. To address the issues for long-term forecasting, in this paper, we propose a universal framework that directly transforms any existing state-of-the-art models for one-step-ahead prediction to achieve more accurate long-term forecasting. The proposed framework consists of two components - a base model and a bias block. The base model is assumed to be a well-trained state-of-the-art one-step-ahead forecasting model, and the bias block is constructed by a spatiotemporal graph neural network composed of gated temporal convolution layers and graph convolution layers. The base model and the bias block are residually-connected so that we can substantially reduce the training complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted on existing benchmark datasets. We experiment with several state-of-the-art models in the literature as base models, and our results demonstrate the ability of the proposed universal framework to greatly improve the long-term prediction accuracy for all models. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - As freight volumes increase, airports are likely to require additional infrastructure development, increased air services, and expanded facilities. Prediction of freight volumes could ensure effective investment. Among the computational intelligence models, support vector regression (SVR) has become the dominant modeling paradigm. In this study, a fuzzy-based SVR (FSVR) model was used to solve the freight volume prediction problem in international airports. The FSVR model can use a fuzzy time series of historical traffic changes for predictions. A fuzzy classification algorithm was used for elements of similar levels in the time series to appropriately divide traffic changes into fuzzy sets, generate membership function values, and establish a fuzzy relationship to produce a fuzzy interpolation with a minimal error. A comparison of the FSVR model with other models revealed that the FSVR model had the lowest mean absolute percentage error (all < 2.5%), mean absolute error, and root mean square error for all types of traffic at all the analyzed airports. Fuzzy sets can handle uncertainty and imprecision in time series. Therefore, the prediction accuracy of the entire time series model is improved by taking advantage of SVR and fuzzy sets. By using the highly accurate FSVR model to predict the future growth of air freight volume, airport management could analyze their existing facilities and service capacity to identify operational bottlenecks and plan future development. The FSVR model is the most accurate forecasting model for air traffic forecasting. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Missing value problem in spatiotemporal traffic data has long been a challenging topic, in particular for large-scale and high-dimensional data with complex missing mechanisms and diverse degrees of missingness. Recent studies based on tensor nuclear norm have demonstrated the superiority of tensor learning in imputation tasks by effectively characterizing the complex correlations/dependencies in spatiotemporal data. However, despite the promising results, these approaches do not scale well to large data tensors. In this paper, we focus on addressing the missing data imputation problem for large-scale spatiotemporal traffic data. To achieve both high accuracy and efficiency, we develop a scalable tensor learning model—Low-Tubal-Rank Smoothing Tensor Completion (LSTC-Tubal)—based on the existing framework of Low-Rank Tensor Completion, which is well-suited for spatiotemporal traffic data that is characterized by multidimensional structure of location × time of day × day. In particular, the proposed LSTC-Tubal model involves a scalable tensor nuclear norm minimization scheme by integrating linear unitary transformation. Therefore, tensor nuclear norm minimization can be solved by singular value thresholding on the transformed matrix of each day while the day-to-day correlation can be effectively preserved by the unitary transform matrix. Before setting up the experiment, we consider some real-world data sets, including two large-scale 5-min traffic speed data sets collected by the California PeMS system with 11160 sensors: 1) PeMS-4W covers the data over 4 weeks (i.e., 288×28 time points), and 2) PeMS-8W covers the data over 8 weeks (i.e., 288×56 time points). We compare LSTC-Tubal with some state-of-the-art baseline models, and find that LSTC-Tubal can achieve competitively accuracy with a significantly lower computational cost. In addition, the LSTC-Tubal will also benefit other tasks in modeling large-scale spatiotemporal traffic data, such as network-level traffic forecasting. © 2021

AB  - Prediction models are used to prevent and prepare for corresponding events according to various types of data generated in production. Aiming at the problems of lower predictive accuracy and slower convergent speed of the existing prediction models, a prediction model based on fireworks algorithm (FWA) and long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed to predict time-related data. Firstly, we establish the interconnection structure model of the hidden layer nodes in the LSTM. Then, considering the diversity and concurrency of the group, we optimize the hyperparameters combination of LSTM. Finally, we improve FWA by adding three mutation operators (Gaussian mutation operator, Cauchy mutation operator, and discrete mutation operator). Based on the enhanced FWA, we achieve a better optimization effect by increasing the diversity of hyperparameters combination. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed LSTM-enhanced FWA model has been significantly improved by comparing to the existing LSTM and LSTM-GS models. The mean absolute error (MAE) is reduced by 38.49% and 17.79%, respectively; the root mean squared error (RMSE) is reduced by 29.47% and 19.28%, respectively; and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is reduced by 36.67% and 26.92%, respectively. MAE and MAPE represent the degree of deviation between the predicted value and actual value, and RMSE well reflects the precision. This means that the proposed LSTM-enhanced FWA model is better than existing LSTM and LSTM-GS models because all three types of error are reduced, meanwhile three kinds of error better reflect accuracy and precision of error. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The rapid development of internet of things (IoT) and in-stream big data processing technology has brought new opportunities for the research of intelligent transportation systems. Traffic forecasting has always been a key issue in the smart transportation system. Aiming at the problem that a fixed model cannot adapt to multiple environments in traffic flow prediction and the problem of model updating for data flow, a traffic flow prediction method is proposed based on variable structure dynamic Bayesian network. Based on the complex event processing and event context, this method divides historical data through context clustering and supports cluster update through online clustering of event streams. For different clustered data, a search-scoring method is used to learn the corresponding Bayesian network structure, and a Bayesian network is approximated based on a Gaussian mixture model. When forecasting online, a suitable model or combination of models is selected according to the current context for prediction. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - Migration and replication of virtual network functions (VNFs) are well-known mechanisms to face dynamic resource requests in Internet Service Provider (ISP) edge networks. They are not only used to reallocate resources in carrier networks, but in case of excessive traffic churns also to offload VNFs to third party cloud providers. We propose to study how traffic forecasting can help to reduce the number of required migrations and replications when the traffic dynamically changes in the network. We analyze and compare three scenarios for the VNF migrations and replications based on: (i) the current observed traffic demands only, (ii) specific maximum traffic demand value observed in the past, or (iii) predictive traffic values. For the prediction of traffic demand values, we use an LSTM model which is proven to be one of the most accurate methods in time series forecasting problems. Based on the traffic prediction model, we then use a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model as well as a greedy algorithm to solve this optimization problem that considers migrations and replications of VNFs. The results show that LSTM-based traffic prediction can reduce the number of migrations up to 45% when there is enough available resources to allocate replicas, while less cloud-based offloading is required compared to overprovisioning. © 2021

AB  - Accurate traffic flow prediction is becoming increasingly important for transportation planning, control, management, and information services of successful. Numerous existing models focus on short-term traffic forecasts, but effective long-term forecasting of traffic flows have become a challenging issue in recent years. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a deep learning architecture which consisting of two parts: the long short-term memory encoder-decoder structure at the bottom and the calibration layer at the top. In the encoder-decoder model, we propose an hard attention mechanism based on learning similar patterns to enhance neuronal memory and reduce the accumulation of error propagation. To correct some of the missing details, we design a control gate in the calibration layer to learn the predicted data in groups according to different forms. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. It is verified that our model can accurately learn local feature and long-term dependence, and has better accuracy and stability in long-term sequence prediction. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Recent advances in technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have provided promising opportunities to solve problems in urban traffic. With the help of IoT technologies, online data from road segments are captured by monitoring devices, while real-time data from vehicles are collected through preinstalled sensors. Based on these data, a CPS model is constructed to depict real-time status and dynamic behavior of road segments and vehicles. An online learning data-driven model is developed to extract prior knowledge and enhance collaboration between road segments and vehicles by combining short-term traffic forecasting and real-time routing optimization. A case study based on Xi'an city is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the travel time with reasonable computation time, without much compromising the travel distance and fuel consumption. This work potentially strengthens the transparency and intelligence of urban traffic systems. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - To meet the ever increasing mobile traffic demand in 5G era, base stations (BSs) have been densely deployed in radio access networks (RANs) to increase the network coverage and capacity. However, as the high density of BSs is designed to accommodate peak traffic, it would consume an unnecessarily large amount of energy if BSs are on during off-peak time. To save the energy consumption of cellular networks, an effective way is to deactivate some idle base stations that do not serve any traffic demand. In this paper, we develop a traffic-aware dynamic BS sleep control framework, named DeepBSC, which presents a novel data-driven learning approach to determine the BS active/sleep modes while meeting lower energy consumption and satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Specifically, the traffic demands are predicted by the proposed GS-STN model, which leverages the geographical and semantic spatial-temporal correlations of mobile traffic. With accurate mobile traffic forecasting, the BS sleep control problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process that is solved by Actor-Critic reinforcement learning methods. To reduce the variance of cost estimation in the dynamic environment, we propose a benchmark transformation method that provides robust performance indicator for policy update. To expedite the training process, we adopt a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) approach, together with an explorer network, which can strengthen the exploration further. Extensive experiments with a real-world dataset corroborate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the existing methods.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Industry 4.0, also known as the Internet of Things, is a concept that encompasses the joint applicability of operation, the Internet, and information technologies to expand the efficiency expectation of automation to include green and flexible processes and innovative products and services. Industrial network infrastructures must be modified to accommodate extra traffic from a variety of technologies in order to achieve this integration. In order to successfully implement cutting-edge wireless technologies, high-quality service (QoS) must be provided to end users. It is thus important to keep an eye on the functioning of the whole network without impacting base station throughput. Improved network performance is constantly needed, even for already-deployed cellular networks, such as the 4th generation (4G) and 3rd generation (3G). For the purpose of forecasting network traffic, an integrated model based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) model was used to combine clustering rough k-means (RKM) and fuzzy c-means (FCM). Clustering granules derived from FCM and RKM were also utilized to examine the network data for each calendar year. The novelty of our proposed model is the integration of the prediction and forecasting results obtained using existing prediction models with centroids of clusters. The WIDE backbone network's live network traffic statistics were used to evaluate the proposed solution. The integrated model's outcomes were assessed using a variety of statistical markers, including mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and standard error. The suggested technique was able to provide findings that were very accurate. The prediction error of LSTM with FCM was less on the basis of the MSE of 0.00783 and RMSE of 0.0885 at the training phase, where the prediction values of LSTM with the RKM had an MSE of 0.00564 and RMSE of 0.7511. Finally, the suggested model may substantially increase the prediction accuracy attained using FCM and RKM clustering.  © 2022 Ali Alzahrani et al.

AB  - Network traffic forecasting is essential for efficient network management and planning. Accurate long-term forecasting models are also essential for proactive control of upcoming congestion events. Due to the complex spatial-temporal dependencies between traffic flows, traditional time series forecasting models are often unable to fully extract the spatial-temporal characteristics between the traffic flows. To address this issue, we propose a novel dual-channel based graph convolutional network (DC-STGCN) model. The proposed model consists of two temporal components that characterize the daily and weekly correlation of the network traffic. Each of these two components contains a spatial-temporal characteristics extraction module consisting of a dual-channel graph convolutional network (DCGCN) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The DCGCN further consists of an adjacency feature extraction module (AGCN) and a correlation feature extraction module (PGCN) to capture the connectivity between nodes and the proximity correlation, respectively. The GRU further extracts the temporal characteristics of the traffic. The experimental results based on real network data sets show that the prediction accuracy of the DC-STGCN model overperforms the existing baseline and is capable of making long-term predictions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Recently, increasing interest in managing pedestrian and bicycle flows has been demon-strated by cities and transportation professionals aiming to reach community goals related to health, safety, and the environment. Precise forecasting of pedestrian and bicycle traffic flow is crucial for identifying the potential use of bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure and improving bicyclists’ safety and comfort. Advances in sensory technology enable collecting massive traffic flow data, including road traffic, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic flow. This paper introduces a novel deep hybrid learning model with a fully guided-attention mechanism to improve bicycles and pedestrians’ traffic flow forecasting. Notably, the proposed approach extends the modeling capability of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by merging a long short-term memory (LSTM) model with the VAE’s decoder and using a self-attention mechanism at multi-stage of the VAE model (i.e., decoder and before data resampling). Specifically, LSTM improves the VAE decoder’s capacity in learning temporal dependencies, and the guided-attention units enable selecting relevant features based on the self-attention mechanism. This proposed deep hybrid learning model with a multi-stage guided-attention mechanism is called GAHD-VAE. Proposed methods were validated with traffic measurements from six publicly available pedestrian and bicycle traffic flow datasets. The proposed method provides promising forecasting results but requires no assumptions that the data are drawn from a given distribution. Results revealed that the GAHD-VAE methodology can efficiently enhance the traffic forecasting accuracy and achieved better performance than the deep learning methods VAE, LSTM, gated recurrent units (GRUs), bidirectional LSTM, bidirectional GRU, convolutional neural network (CNN), and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), and four shallow methods, linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, and support vector regression. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is the most critical part of any traffic management system in a smart city. It can help a driver to pick the most optimized way to their target destination. Air pollution data are often connected with traffic congestion and there exists plenty of research on the connection between air pollution and traffic congestion using different machine learning approaches. A scheme for efficiently predicting traffic flow using ensemble techniques such as bagging and air pollution has not yet been introduced. Therefore, there is a need for a more accurate traffic flow prediction system for the smart cities. The aim of this research is to forecast traffic flow using pollution data. The contribution is twofold: Firstly, a comparison has been made using different simple regression techniques to find out the best-performing model. Secondly, bagging and stacking ensemble techniques have been used to find out the most accurate model of the two comparisons. The results show that the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) bagging ensemble provides far better results than all the other regression models used in this study. The experimental results show that the KNN bagging ensemble model reduces the error rate in predicting the traffic congestion by more than 30%. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The demand for high steady state network traffic utilization is growing exponentially. Therefore, traffic forecasting has become essential for powering greedy application and services such as the internet of things (IoT) and Big data for 5G networks for better resource planning, allocation, and optimization. The accuracy of forecasting modeling has become crucial for fundamental network operations such as routing management, congestion management, and to guarantee quality of service overall. In this paper, a hybrid network forecast model was analyzed; the model combines a non-linear auto regressive neural network (NARNN) and various smoothing techniques, namely, local regression (LOESS), moving average, locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS), the Sgolay filter, Robyn loess (RLOESS), and robust locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (RLOWESS). The effects of applying smoothing techniques with varied smoothing windows were shown and the performance of the hybrid NARNN and smoothing techniques discussed. The results show that the hybrid model can effectively be used to enhance forecasting performance in terms of forecasting accuracy, with the assistance of the smoothing techniques, which minimized data losses. In this work, root mean square error (RMSE) is used as performance measures and the results were verified via statistical significance tests. © 2021, Telkomnika (Telecommunication Computing Electronics and Control).

AB  - Network dimensioning is a critical task in current mobile networks, as any failure in this process leads to degraded user experience or unnecessary upgrades of network resources. For this purpose, radio planning tools often predict monthly busy-hour data traffic to detect capacity bottle-necks in advance. Supervised Learning (SL) arises as a promising solution to improve predictions obtained with legacy approaches. Previous works have shown that deep learning outperforms classical time series analysis when predicting data traffic in cellular networks in the short term (sec-onds/minutes) and medium term (hours/days) from long historical data series. However, long-term forecasting (several months horizon) performed in radio planning tools relies on short and noisy time series, thus requiring a separate analysis. In this work, we present the first study comparing SL and time series analysis approaches to predict monthly busy-hour data traffic on a cell basis in a live LTE network. To this end, an extensive dataset is collected, comprising data traffic per cell for a whole country during 30 months. The considered methods include Random Forest, different Neural Networks, Support Vector Regression, Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average and Additive Holt–Winters. Results show that SL models outperform time series approaches, while reducing data storage capacity requirements. More importantly, unlike in short-term and medium-term traffic forecasting, non-deep SL approaches are competitive with deep learning while being more computationally efficient. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Wireless network traffic estimation is of paramount importance for commercial network operators. Accurate traffic forecasting impacts resource allocation that ultimately influences the quality of service perceived by network clients. This kind of forecasting is particularly challenging in real-time scenarios since this operation demands the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, which may be prohibitively complex in some scenarios. This article analyzes the trade-off between traffic forecasting accuracy and the complexity of artificial intelligence algorithms applied to this end. Such analysis brings a consistent contribution since the results allow network operators to select the most suitable model for their needs, leading to a well-organized resource sharing initiative that can reduce the amount of investment demanded by these operators to provide a high quality of service to their clients. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic forecasting problem remains a challenging task in the intelligent transportation system due to its spatio-temporal complexity. Although temporal dependency has been well studied and discussed, spatial dependency is relatively less explored due to its large variations, especially in the urban environment. In this study, a novel graph convolutional network model, Multi-Weight Traffic Graph Convolutional (MW-TGC) network, is proposed and applied to two urban networks with contrasting geometric constraints. The model conducts graph convolution operations on speed data with multi-weighted adjacency matrices to combine the features, including speed limit, distance, and angle. The spatially isolated dimension reduction operation is conducted on the combined features to learn the dependencies among the features and reduce the size of the output to a computationally feasible level. The output of multi-weight graph convolution is applied to the sequence-to-sequence model with Long Short-Term Memory units to learn temporal dependencies. When applied to two urban sites, urban-core and urban-mix, MW-TGC network not only outperformed the comparative models in both sites but also reduced variance in the heterogeneous urban-mix network. We conclude that MW-TGC network can provide a robust traffic forecasting performance across the variations in spatial complexity, which can be a strong advantage in urban traffic forecasting. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a challenging problem in the transportation research field as the complexity and non-stationary changing of the traffic data, thus the key to the issue is how to explore proper spatial and temporal characteristics. Based on this thought, many creative methods have been proposed, in which Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based methods have shown promising performance. However, these methods depend on the graph construction, which mainly uses the prior knowledge of the road network. Recently, some works realized the fact of the road network graph changing and tried to construct dynamic graphs for GCN, but they do not fully exploit the spatial and temporal properties of the traffic data in the graph construction. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic graph convolution network for traffic forecasting, in which a latent network is introduced to extract spatial-temporal features for constructing the dynamic road network graph matrices adaptively. The proposed method is evaluated on several traffic datasets and the experimental results show that it outperforms the state of the art traffic forecasting methods.

AB  - This work presents an analysis of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based forecasting models for vehicular traffic flow. The forecasting was performed for three periods of time: 1 week, 1 month and 1 year. The vehicular traffic flow data analysed were collected from Interstate 87, a highway located within the U.S. state of New York. Temporal and climate information, such as weekday, time of day, precipitation, visibility and temperature, were provided to the ANNs. Two different architectures were implemented to forecast vehicular traffic flow: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The performance was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and comparing the predicted flow with the real data in the evaluated period. The MLP resulted in RMSE of 113.96, 185.98 and 201.19, and MAP of 9.56%, 15.49% and 16.95% for a forecasting interval of 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, respectively. Similarly, the LSTM network resulted in RMSE of 122.20, 179.55 and 203.63 and MAPE of 14.66%, 17.89% and 24.10% for the same time periods. Additionally, the two developed ANNs were evaluated to perform a forecasting vehicular traffic flow for another highway, the Interstate 88. The results from the two ANNs are similar, the MLP network resulted in MAPE of 17.15%, 25.65% and 19.76% for a forecasting interval of 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, respectively. On the other hand, the LSTM network presented RMSE of 19.14%, 31.87% and 22.97%. The results obtained come close to the similar work results when considered shorter prediction periods. The results for longer prediction time could not be compared to the literature due to the lack of work in this area, being a novelty of the current work. Moreover, the models implemented in this paper were precise and stable and can be used as strategy information to help road and cities planning. In addition, results have shown that the model can be replicated for other roads in the same region or either from other states or countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Accurate and explainable short-term traffic forecasting is pivotal for making trustworthy decisions in advanced traffic control and guidance systems. Recently, deep learning approach, as a data-driven alternative to traffic flow model-based data assimilation and prediction methods, has become popular in this domain. Many of these deep learning models show promising predictive performance, but inherently suffer from a lack of interpretability. This difficulty largely originates from the inconsistency between the static input–output mappings encoded in deep neural networks and the dynamic nature of traffic phenomena. Under different traffic conditions, such as freely-flowing versus heavily congested traffic, different mappings are needed to predict the propagation of congestion and the resulting speeds over the network more accurately. In this study, we design a novel variant of the graph attention mechanism. The major innovation of this so-called dynamic graph convolution (DGC) module is that local area-wide graph convolutional kernels are dynamically generated from evolving traffic states to capture real-time spatial dependencies. When traffic conditions change, the spatial correlation encoded by DGC module changes as well. Using the DGC, we propose a multistep traffic forecasting model, the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (DGCN). Experiments using real freeway data show that the DGCN has a competitive predictive performance compared to other state-of-the-art models. Equally importantly, the prediction process in the DGCN and the trained parameters are indeed explainable. It turns out that the DGCN learns to mimic the upstream–downstream asymmetric information flow of typical road traffic operations. Specifically, there exists a speed-dependent optimal receptive field – which governs what information the DGC kernels assimilate – that is consistent with the back-propagation speed of stop-and-go waves in traffic streams. This implies that the learnt parameters are consistent with traffic flow theory. We believe that this research paves a path to more transparent deep learning models applied for short-term traffic forecasting. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Short-term road traffic speed prediction is a long-standing topic in the area of Intelligent Transportation System. Apparently, effective prediction of the traffic speed on the road can not only provide timely details for the navigation system concerned and help the drivers to make better path selection, but also greatly improve the road supervision efficiency of the traffic department. At present, some researches on speed prediction based on GPS data, by adding weather and other auxiliary information, using graph convolutional neural network to capture the temporal and spatial characteristics, have achieved excellent results. In this paper, the problem of short-term traffic speed prediction based on GPS positioning data is further studied. For the processing of time series, we innovatively introduce Dynamic Time Warping algorithm into the problem and propose a Long Short-Term Memory with Dynamic Time Warping (D-LSTM) model. D-LSTM model, which integrates Dynamic Time Warping algorithm, can fine-tune the time feature, thus adjusting the current data distribution to be close to the historical data. More importantly, the fine-tuned data can still get a distinct improvement without special treatment of holidays. Meanwhile, considering that the data under different feature distributions have different effects on the prediction results, attention mechanism is also introduced in the model. Our experiments show that our proposed model D-LSTM performs better than other basic models in many kinds of traffic speed prediction problems with different time intervals, and especially significant in the traffic speed prediction on weekends. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic speed forecasting is one of the core problems in transportation systems. For a more accurate prediction, recent studies started using not only the temporal speed patterns but also the spatial information on the road network through the graph convolutional networks. Even though the road network is highly complex due to its non-Euclidean and directional characteristics, previous approaches mainly focused on modeling the spatial dependencies using the distance only. In this paper, we identify two essential spatial dependencies in traffic forecasting in addition to distance, direction and positional relationship, for designing basic graph elements as the fundamental building blocks. Using the building blocks, we suggest DDP-GCN (Distance, Direction, and Positional relationship Graph Convolutional Network) to incorporate the three spatial relationships into deep neural networks. We evaluate the proposed model with two large-scale real-world datasets, and find positive improvements for long-term forecasting in highly complex urban networks. The improvement can be larger for commute hours, but it can be also limited for short-term forecasting. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate and timely traffic forecasting is an important task for the realization of urban smart traffic. The random occurrence of social events such as traffic accidents will make traffic prediction particularly difficult. At the same time, most of the existing prediction methods rely on prior knowledge to obtain traffic maps and the obtained map structure cannot be guaranteed to be accurate for the current learning task. In addition, traffic data is highly non-linear and long-term dependent, so it is more difficult to achieve accurate prediction. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a new integrated unified architecture for traffic prediction based on heterogeneous graph attention network combined with residual-time-series convolutional network, which is called HGA-ResTCN. First, the heterogeneous graph attention is used to capture the changes in the relationship between the traffic graph nodes caused by social events, so as to learn the link weights between the target node and its neighbor nodes; at the same time, by introducing the timing of residual links convolutional network to capture the long-term dependence of complex traffic data. These two models are integrated into a unified framework to learn in an end-to-end manner. Through testing on real-world data sets, the results show that the accuracy of the model in this paper is better than other proposed baselines. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the significant utilization of terrestrial communication, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network is a critical part of satellite communication networks owing to its several benefits. But the efficient and trustworthy routing for LEO satellite networks (LSNs) is a difficult process because of dynamic topology, adequate link changes, and imbalanced communication load. This study devises a new hybridization of extreme learning machine (ELM) with multitask beetle antennae search (MBAS) algorithm-based distributed routing called the MBAS-ELM model. The proposed model determines the routes based on traffic forecasting with respect to the level of traffic circulation on the earth. The proposed method is employed for traffic forecasting at the satellite nodes (SNs). To identify the optimal routes, mobile agents (MAs) are applied to concurrently and autonomously determine for LSNs and make a decision on routing data. The experimental outcome has showcased the effective performance of the proposed model over the compared models in terms of different measures, namely, average delay, packet loss ratio (PLR), and queuing delay. The results are validated under varying simulation time and data sensing rates. The obtained outcome pointed out the superior performance of the proposed MBAS-ELM model compared with other methods. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is of vital importance for the management and decision in intelligent transportation systems. Indeed, it is a nontrivial endeavor to predict future traffic conditions due to the complexity of spatial relationships and temporal dependencies. Recent research developed Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) to capture the spatio-temporal correlations and achieved superior performance. However, the graph adjacency matrices that most ST-GNNs use are either pre-defined by heuristic rules or directly learned with trainable parameters. While node attributes, which record valuable information of traffic conditions, have not been fully exploited to guide the learning of better graph structure. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal graph neural Network, namely Ada-STNet, to first derive optimal graph structure with the guidance of node attributes and then capture the complicated spatio-temporal correlations via a dedicated spatio-temporal convolution architecture for multi-step traffic condition forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a graph structure learning component to obtain an optimal graph adjacency matrix from both macro and micro perspectives. Next, we design a dedicated spatio-temporal convolution architecture to learn spatial relationships and temporal dependencies. Moreover, we present a two-stage training strategy to improve the model performance. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the era of the digital world. The communication and the use the internet is an important role in today’s society. As a result, the number of users networks traffic increases but not enough resources for users causing users to receive inefficient services. Therefore, the network service provider must take action to fix the aforementioned problem. Forecasting is therefore necessary in order to determine the amount of network traffic in order to support the future increase in user numbers. Consequently, this research investigates to assess network traffic forecasts comparing the machine learning: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and statistical methods: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Simple Moving Average (SMA). The method of sliding window will be used simultaneously and evaluate the forecast and model performance using the MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE and R-square algorithms, respectively. The results show that machine learning forecasting is more effective than statistical forecasting. Because the error value is lower, the model can reliably anticipate data. Therefore, the results of this research are expected to help network service provider to improve their networks quickly and efficiently to accommodate the number of users that may increase in the future. © 2022, Engg Journals Publications.

AB  - Road traffic flow forecasting is among the most important use case associated with smart cities. Traffic forecasting allows drivers to select the fastest route towards their target destinations. A prerequisite for traffic flow management is accurate traffic forecasting. In this study, we introduce a framework for traffic forecasting that uses data on air pollution. The reason to select that data is air pollution rates are often associated with traffic congestion, and there is intensive research that exists to forecast air pollution by road traffic. To the best of our knowledge, any effort to enhance road traffic prediction through air quality and ensemble regression model techniques is not yet been proposed. In this research, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we have performed a comparative analysis of 7 different regression models to find out which model gives better accuracy. Secondly, we propose a framework using regression models in which the first regression model's result is boosted using boosting ensemble method and is passed to the next regression model which shows that the proposed framework gives more satisfying results than the above 7 regression models. The experimental findings show the effectiveness of the proposed framework which decreases the error rate by 2.47 %. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. However, the prediction task is highly challenging due to the mixture of global and local spatiotemporal dependencies involved in traffic data. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) typically capture spatial dependencies with the predefined or learnable static graph structure, ignoring the hidden dynamic patterns in traffic networks. Meanwhile, most recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) cannot effectively capture temporal correlations, especially for long-term temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a spatial–temporal attention graph convolution network (STAGCN), which acquires a static graph and a dynamic graph from data without any prior knowledge. The static graph aims to model global space adaptability, and the dynamic graph is designed to capture local dynamics in the traffic network. A gated temporal attention module is further introduced for long-term temporal dependencies, where a causal-trend attention mechanism is proposed to increase the awareness of causality and local trends in time series. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that STAGCN achieves an outstanding prediction accuracy improvement over existing solutions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Transportation planning has historically relied on statistical models to analyze travel patterns across space and time. Recently, an urgency has developed in the United States to address outdated policies and approaches to infrastructure planning, design, and construction. Policymakers at the federal, state, and local levels are expressing greater interest in promoting and funding sustainable transportation infrastructure systems to reduce the damaging effects of pollutive emissions. Consequently, there is a growing trend of local agencies transitioning away from the traditional level-of-service measures to vehicle miles of travel (VMT) measures. However, planners are finding it difficult to leverage their investments in their regional travel demand network models and datasets in the transition. This paper evaluates the applicability of VMT forecasting and impact assessment using the current travel demand model for Dane County, Wisconsin. The main finding is that exploratory spatial data analysis of the derived data uncovered statistically significant spatial relationships and interactions that planners cannot sufficiently visualize using other methods. Planners can apply these techniques to identify places where focused VMT remediation measures for sustainable networks and environments can be most cost-effective. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The traffic jam is increasingly aggravating in almost every urban area. Traffic forecast, traffic modeling, and visualization can help to provide an appropriate route and time for traveling and thus provides a significant impact on traffic jam reduction. For traffic forecasting, modeling, and visualization, city-wide traffic data collection and analysis are needed, which are still challenging in many aspects. This paper aims to develop a tool for acquiring and processing traffic data from Google Maps that can be used for forecasting, modeling, and visualization. Dhaka city is used as a case study since there is no infrastructure available for traffic data collection. The traffic flow intensity of the road is analyzed to determine the congestion of the road. The flow intensity is used for traffic modeling, visualization, traffic prediction, and more.  Copyright © 2022, IGI Global.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is an essential task of an intelligent transportation system (ITS), closely related to intelligent transportation management and resource scheduling. Dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data make traffic flow forecasting to be a challenging task. Most existing research cannot model dynamic spatial and temporal correlations to achieve well-forecasting performance. The multi-head self-attention mechanism is a valuable method to capture dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, and combining it with graph convolutional networks is a promising solution. Therefore, we propose a multi-head self-attention spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (MSASGCN) model. It can effectively capture local correlations and potential global correlations of spatial structures, can handle dynamic evolution of the road network, and, in the time dimension, can effectively capture dynamic temporal correlations. Experiments on two real datasets verify the stability of our proposed model, obtaining a better prediction performance than the baseline algorithms. The correlation metrics get significantly reduced compared with traditional time series prediction methods and deep learning methods without using graph neural networks, according to MAE and RMSE results. Compared with advanced traffic flow forecasting methods, our model also has a performance improvement and a more stable prediction performance. We also discuss some problems and challenges in traffic forecasting.  © 2022 Yang Cao et al.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a critical challenge for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), increasingly enabled by the deepening interconnectedness of intelligent vehicles and traffic infrastructures. In this study, we propose a hybrid short-term forecasting architecture based on the careful consideration and analysis of reservation-based behavior cooperation and the characteristics of Cooperative ITS (C-ITS), especially its future application mode of Service-oriented C-ITS (SoC-ITS). We design several novel models and mechanisms to forecast the behavioral parameters of road vehicles in this architecture, combining a developed artificial neural network method and a statistical technique. Considering the lack of large-scale deployment of C-ITS at present, a new simulator (SoC-ITSS v2.1) is independently designed with two main aims. The first is to establish a massive dataset that is unavailable for current transportation systems, but necessary for back propagation neural network-based forecasting and statistics models. Our second aim is to provide an effective visual verification environment for this proposed mechanism. Using our newly developed simulator, these proposed models and methods are verified under two typical authorization policies (First-Arrival-First-Pass-Multi-Queue for ordinary C-ITS and Highest-Weight-First-Pass-Multi-Queue for SoC-ITS). The experimental results show that this forecasting mechanism can adaptively model traffic situations of both ordinary C-ITS and SoC-ITS, and provide good performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is the basic challenge in intelligent transportation system (ITS). The key problem is to improve the accuracy of model and capture the dynamic temporal and nonlinear spatial dependence. Using real data is one of the ways to improve the spatial-temporal correlation modeling accuracy. However, real traffic flow data are not strictly periodic because of some random factors, which may lead to some deviations. This study focuses on capturing and modeling the temporal perturbation in real periodic data and we propose a spatial-temporal similar graph attention network (STSGAN) to address this problem. In STSGAN, the spatial-temporal graph convolution module is to capture local spatial-temporal relationship in traffic data, and the periodic similar attention module is to treat the nonlinear traffic flow information. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model is best among all methods.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Due to its usefulness in various social contexts, from Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) to the reduction of urban pollution, road traffic prediction represents an active research area in the scientific community, with strong potential impact on citizens’ well-being. Already considered a non-trivial problem, in many real applications an additional level of complexity is given by the large amount of data requiring Big Data domain technologies. In this paper, we present the first steps of a novel approach integrating both classic and machine learning models in the Spark-based big data architecture of the H2020 CLASS project, and we perform preliminary tests to see how usually little-considered variables (different data aggregation levels, time horizons and traffic density levels) influence the error of the different models. © 2022.

AB  - Accurate short-term traffic forecasting is the cornerstone for Intelligent Transportation Systems. In the past several decades, many models have been proposed to continuously improve the predictive accuracy. A key but unsolved question is whether there is a theoretical bound to the accuracy with which traffic can be predicted and whether that limit can be directly estimated from data. To answer this question, we use core concepts in information theory to derive the limit of predictability in short-term traffic forecasting. Theoretical analysis proves that conditional differential entropy poses a rigorous lower bound of negative-log-likelihood (NLL) for probabilistic models. And the continuous form of Fano's theorem further gives a loose lower bound of mean-square-error (MSE) for deterministic models. Based on the special properties of traffic dynamics, two assumptions are made in the estimate of entropy metrics: cyclostationarity (traffic phenomena show strong periodicity) and localized spatial correlation (due to kinematic wave propagation). They allow formulating the limit of predictability as a function of longitudinal space and time-of-day which finds the most uncertain locations and periods solely from data. Experiments on univariate traffic accumulation forecasting and network-level speed forecasting show that the selected models, including some state-of-the-art deep learning models, indeed cannot outperform the estimated lower bounds but just approach them. The limit of predictability depends on time-of-day, network locations, observation range, and prediction horizon. The results reveal that the stochastic nature of traffic dynamics and improper assumptions on the prior distribution of output are two major factors that restrict the predictive performance. In summary, the proposed method estimates a trustworthy performance boundary for most traffic forecasting models. These conclusions are helpful for further studies in this domain. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Traffic forecasting is highly challenging due to its complex spatial and temporal dependencies in the traffic network. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) has been effectively used for traffic forecasting due to its excellent performance in modelling spatial dependencies. In most existing approaches, GCN models spatial dependencies in the traffic network with a fixed adjacency matrix. However, the spatial dependencies change over time in the actual situation. In this paper, we propose a graph learning-based spatial-temporal graph convolutional neural network (GLSTGCN) for traffic forecasting. To capture the dynamic spatial dependencies, we design a graph learning module to learn the dynamic spatial relationships in the traffic network. To save training time and computation resources, we adopt dilated causal convolution networks with a gating mechanism to capture long-term temporal correlations in traffic data. We conducted extensive experiments using two real-world traffic datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GLSTGCN achieves superior performance than all state-of-art baselines. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of short-term traffic prediction for signalized traffic operations management. Specifically, we focus on predicting sensor states in high-resolution (second-by-second). This contrasts with traditional traffic forecasting problems, which have focused on predicting aggregated traffic variables, typically over intervals that are no shorter than five minutes. Our contributions can be summarized as offering three insights: first, we show how the prediction problem can be modeled as a matrix completion problem. Second, we use a block-coordinate descent algorithm and demonstrate that the algorithm converges in sublinear time to a block coordinate-wise optimizer. This allows us to capitalize on the “bigness” of high-resolution data in a computationally feasible way. Third, we develop an ensemble learning (or adaptive boosting) approach to reduce the training error to within any arbitrary error threshold. The latter uses past days so that the boosting can be interpreted as capturing periodic patterns in the data. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically and tested empirically using both simulated data and a real-world high-resolution traffic data set from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. Copyright: © 2021 INFORMS

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a challenging problem because of the irregular and complex road network in space and the dynamic and non-stationary traffic flow in time. To solve this problem, the recently proposed temporal graph convolution models abstracted the spatial and temporal features of the traffic system and obtained considerable improvement. However, most of the current methods use empirical graphs to represent the road network, which don't fully extract the spatial and temporal features. This paper proposes an Optimized Temporal-Spatial Gated Graph Convolution Network (OTSGGCN) for traffic forecasting, in which the spatial-temporal traffic feature is captured by an innovative graph convolution network with the graph constructed in a data-driven way. The experiments on two real-world traffic datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art traffic forecasting methods.  © 2009-2012 IEEE.

AB  - An increase in autonomous vehicles (AVs) would result in a decline in traffic congestion; however, the travel cost associated with AVs is always higher than that of manually-driven vehicles (MV). This situation is interpreted as a so-called multi-player social dilemma. This study designed an economic experiment to investigate the effect of AVs on mode choice in mixed traffic flows. Participants were informed about the cost function in both modes and were asked to choose the travel mode for more than 60 rounds. In full information (FI) treatment, participants received information about the travel costs of the AV and MV modes at the end of each round. In the partial information (PI) treatment, participants received information only about the travel cost of the mode they chose. We found that participants were sensitive to cost differences in the FI treatments. Based on inequality aversion models, we proposed a perceived cost that could better explain the experimental equilibrium. A monetary reward was provided to encourage participants to take AVs and solve social dilemmas. The results demonstrated that the reward mechanism reduces traffic congestion and increases social benefits, especially in the FI treatment. Finally, a learning model that considers inertia and perceived cost is proposed to explain the decision-making process of the participants during the experiment. The findings have implications for traffic forecasting in the mixed flow of MVs and AVs and provide insights and policy suggestions for AV management. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is the upstream problem of path planning, intelligent transportation system, and other tasks. Many studies have been carried out on the traffic flow prediction of the spatio-temporal network, but the effects of spatio-temporal flexibility (historical data of the same type of time intervals in the same location will change flexibly) and spatio-temporal correlation (different road conditions have different effects at different times) have not been considered at the same time. We propose the Deep Spatio-temporal Adaptive 3D Convolution Neural Network (ST-A3DNet), which is a new scheme to solve both spatio-temporal correlation and flexibility, and consider spatio-temporal complexity (complex external factors, such as weather and holidays). Different from other traffic forecasting models, ST-A3DNet captures the spatio-temporal relationship at the same time through the Adaptive 3D convolution module, assigns different weights flexibly according to the influence of historical data, and obtains the impact of external factors on the flow through the ex-mask module. Considering the holidays and weather conditions, we train our model for experiments in Xi'an and Chengdu. We evaluate the ST-A3DNet and the results show that we have better results than the other 11 baselines. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Long short-term memory (LSTM) is becoming increasingly popular in the short-term flow. In order to develop high-quality prediction models, it is worth investigating the LSTM potential deeply for traffic flow prediction. This study has two objectives: first, to observe the effect of using different sized training sets in LSTM training for various and numerous databases; second, to develop a clustering model that contributes to adjusting the training set size. For this purpose, 83 datasets were divided into certain sizes and LSTM model performances were examined depending on these training set sizes. As a result, enlargement of the training set size reduced LSTM errors monotonic for certain datasets. This phenomenon was modeled with the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression and pattern recognition networks (PRNet). In these models, statistical properties of datasets were utilized as input. The best results were obtained by PRNet, and SVM model performance was closest to PRNet. This study indicates that enlarging the training set size in traffic flow prediction increases the LSTM performance monotonically for specific datasets. In addition, a high-precision clustering model is presented to assist researchers in short-term traffic forecasting to adjust the size of the training set. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a very challenging task due to the complicated and dynamic spatial–temporal correlations between traffic nodes. Most existing methods measure the spatial correlations by defining physical or virtual graphs with distance or similarity measurement, which is constructed with stable edge connections by some prior knowledge. However, the use of such graphs with stable edge connections limits the variations of spatial correlations between traffic nodes at different times, which can not capture the hidden dynamic patterns of traffic graphs. This paper proposes a Time-Variant Graph Convolutional Network (TVGCN) to overcome this limitation. Architecturally, a time-variant spatial convolutional module (TV-SCM) is developed on two graphs without any prior knowledge. One graph is learned to capture the stable spatial correlations of the traffic graph, while the other graph is evolved to model dynamic spatial correlations at different times. Such two graphs are combined hierarchically together under the framework of graph convolutional network (GCN). Moreover, a gated multi-scale temporal convolutional module (GMS-TCM) is designed to extract long-range temporal dependencies within traffic nodes, which are further supplied to the TV-SCM to mutually explore the spatial correlations between traffic nodes. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world traffic datasets indicate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Deep learning has achieved good performance in short-term traffic forecasting recently. However, the stochasticity and distribution imbalance are main characteristics to traffic flow, and these will bring the uncertainty and induce the network overfitting problem during deep learning. To deal with the problems, a new end-to-end hybrid deep learning network model, named M-B-LSTM, is proposed for short-term traffic flow forecasting in this paper. In the M-B-LSTM model, an online self-learning network is constructed as a data mapping layer to learn and equalize the traffic flow statistic distribution for reducing the effect of distribution imbalance and overfitting problem during network learning. Besides, the deep bidirectional long short-term memory network (DBLSTM) is introduced to reduce the uncertainty problem by forward and reverse contexts approximation process in the stochasticity reducing layer, and then the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to forecast the next traffic flow state in the forecasting layer. Furthermore, sufficient comparative experiments have been conducted and the results show the proposed model has better ability on solving uncertainty and overfitting problems than the state-of-art methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Rapid growth of network traffic causes the need for the development of new network technologies. Artificial intelligence provides suitable tools to improve currently used network optimization methods. In this paper, we propose a procedure for network traffic prediction. Based on optical networks’ (and other network technologies) characteristics, we focus on the prediction of fixed bitrate levels called traffic levels. We develop and evaluate two approaches based on different supervised machine learning (ML) methods—classification and regression. We examine four different ML models with various selected features. The tested datasets are based on real traffic patterns provided by the Seattle Internet Exchange Point (SIX). Obtained results are analyzed using a new quality metric, which allows researchers to find the best forecasting algorithm in terms of network resources usage and operational costs. Our research shows that regression provides better results than classification in case of all analyzed datasets. Additionally, the final choice of the most appropriate ML algorithm and model should depend on the network operator expectations. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Traffic management in a city has become a major problem due to the increasing number of vehicles on roads. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can help the city traffic managers to tackle the problem by providing accurate traffic forecasts. For this, ITS requires a reliable traffic prediction algorithm that can provide accurate traffic prediction at multiple time steps based on past and current traffic data. In recent years, a number of different methods for traffic prediction have been proposed which have proved their effectiveness in terms of accuracy. However, most of these methods have either considered spatial information or temporal information only and overlooked the effect of other. In this paper, to address the above problem a deep learning based approach has been developed using both the spatial and temporal dependencies. To consider spatio-temporal dependencies, nearby road sensors at a particular instant are selected based on the attributes like traffic similarity and distance. Two pre-trained deep auto-encoders were cross-connected using the concept of latent space mapping and the resultant model was trained using the traffic data from the selected nearby sensors as input. The proposed deep learning based approach was trained using the real-world traffic data collected from loop detector sensors installed on different highways of Los Angeles and Bay Area. The traffic data is freely available from the web portal of the California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The effectiveness of the proposed approach was verified by comparing it with a number of machine/deep learning approaches. It has been found that the proposed approach provides accurate traffic prediction results even for 60-min ahead prediction with least error than other techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic forecasting remains an active area of research in the transport and data science fields. Decision-makers rely on traffic forecasting models for both policy-making and operational management of transport facilities. The wealth of spatial and temporal real-time data increasingly available from traffic sensors on roads provides a valuable source of information for policymakers. This paper adopts the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict speed by considering both the spatial and temporal characteristics of real-time sensor data. A total of 288,653 real-life traffic measurements were collected from detector stations on the Eastern Freeway in Melbourne/Australia. A comparative performance analysis among different models such as the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that has an internal memory that is able to remember its inputs and Deep Learning Backpropagation (DLBP) neural network approaches are also reported. The LSTM results showed average accuracies in the outbound direction ranging between 88 and 99 percent over prediction horizons between 5 and 60 min, and average accuracies between 96 and 98 percent in the inbound direction. The models also showed resilience in accuracies as the prediction horizons increased spatially for distances up to 15 km, providing a remarkable performance compared to other models tested. These results demonstrate the superior performance of LSTM models in capturing the spatial and temporal traffic dynamics, providing decision-makers with robust models to plan and manage transport facilities more effectively. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the increasing popularity of the intelligent transportation system, a large number of sensing devices are installed on the road for monitoring traffic dynamics in real time. These sensors can collect streaming traffic data distributed across different traffic sites, which constitute the main source of big traffic data. Analyzing and mining such big traffic data in massive IoT can help traffic administrations to make scientific and reasonable traffic scheduling decisions, so as to avoid prospective traffic congestions in the future. However, the above traffic decision making often requires frequent and massive data transmissions between distributed sensors and centralized cloud computing centers, which calls for lightweight data integrations and accurate data analyses based on large-scale traffic data. In view of this challenge, a big data-driven and nonparametric model aided by 6G is proposed in this article to extract similar traffic patterns over time for accurate and efficient short-term traffic flow prediction in massive IoT, which is mainly based on time-aware locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). We design a wide range of experiments based on a real-world big traffic data set to validate the feasibility of our proposal. Experimental reports demonstrate that the prediction accuracy and efficiency of our proposal are increased by 32.6% and 97.3%, respectively, compared with the other two competitive approaches. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Due to great advances in wireless communication, the connected Internet of vehicles (CIoVs) has become prevalent. Naturally, internal connections among active vehicles are an indispensable factor in traffic forecasting. Although many related research studies have been conducted in the past few years, they mainly designed and/or developed single forecasting models for traffic forecasting. Such models may show ideal performance in some scenarios but lack satisfactory robustness to dynamic scenario changes. To address this challenge, a graph neural network-driven traffic forecasting model for CIoVs is proposed in this work, which is denoted as Gra-TF. In this paper, we regard the dynamics of traffic data as a temporal evolution scenario. With the assistance of ensemble learning, three typical graph-level prediction methods are employed to construct an integrated and enhanced forecasting model. This design utilizes several methods to minimize uncertainty in CIoVs. Finally, we use a real-world dataset to build an experimental scenario for further assessment. Numerical results indicate that the proposed Gra-TF improves the prediction accuracy by 30% to 40% compared with several baseline methods.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate and reliable traffic forecasting for complicated transportation networks is of vital importance to modern transportation management. The complicated spatial dependencies of roadway links and the dynamic temporal patterns of traffic states make it particularly challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a new capsule network (CapsNet) to extract the spatial features of traffic networks and utilize a nested LSTM (NLSTM) structure to capture the hierarchical temporal dependencies in traffic sequence data. A framework for network-level traffic forecasting is also proposed by sequentially connecting CapsNet and NLSTM. On the basis of literature review, our study is the first to adopt CapsNet and NLSTM in the field of traffic forecasting. An experiment on a Beijing transportation network with 278 links shows that the proposed framework with the capability of capturing complicated spatiotemporal traffic patterns outperforms multiple state-of-the-art traffic forecasting baseline models. The superiority and feasibility of CapsNet and NLSTM are also demonstrated, respectively, by visualizing and quantitatively evaluating the experimental results. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Short-term traffic forecasting is important for the development of an intelligent traffic management system. Critical to the performance of the traffic prediction model utilized in such a system is accurate representation of the spatiotemporal traffic characteristics. This can be achieved by integrating spatiotemporal traffic information or the dynamic traffic characteristics in the modeling process. The currently employed spatiotemporal k-nearest neighbor (STKNN) model is based on the spatial heterogeneity and adaptive spatiotemporal parameters of the traffic to improve the prediction accuracy. However, the non-stationary characteristics of the traffic cannot be fully represented by simply modeling the entire time range or all the time partitions based on experience. We therefore developed a dynamic STKNN model (D-STKNN) for short-term traffic forecasting based on the non-stationary spatiotemporal pattern of the road traffic. The different traffic patterns along the road are first automatically determined using an affinity propagation clustering algorithm. The Warped K-Means algorithm is then used to automatically partition the time periods for each traffic pattern. Finally, the D-STKNN model is developed based on the three-dimensional spatiotemporal tensor data models for the different road segments with different traffic patterns during different time periods. The D-STKNN model was verified through extensive experiments performed using actual vehicular speed datasets collected from city roads in Beijing, China, and expressways in California, U.S.A. The proposed model outperforms existing seven baselines in different time periods under different traffic patterns. The results confirmed the imperative of considering the non-stationary spatiotemporal traffic pattern in developing a model for short-term traffic prediction.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Urban traffic forecasting models generally follow either a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) or a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to estimate the features of potential road accidents. Although SVC can provide good performances with less data than GMM, it incurs a higher computational cost. This paper proposes a novel framework that combines the descriptive strength of the Gaussian Mixture Model with the high-performance classification capabilities of the Support Vector Classifier. A new approach is presented that uses the mean vectors obtained from the GMM model as input to the SVC. Experimental results show that the approach compares very favorably with baseline statistical methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is important to enable intelligent transportation systems in a smart city. This problem is challenging due to the complicated spatial, short-term temporal and long-term periodical dependencies. Existing approaches have considered these factors in modeling. Most solutions apply CNN, or its extension Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) to model the spatial correlation. However, the convolution operator may not adequately model the non-Euclidean pair-wise correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-based Periodicoral neural Network (APTN), an end-to-end solution for traffic foresting that captures spatial, short-term, and long-term periodical dependencies. APTN first uses an encoder attention mechanism to model both the spatial and periodical dependencies. Our model can capture these dependencies more easily because every node attends to all other nodes in the network, which brings regularization effect to the model and avoids overfitting between nodes. Then, a temporal attention is applied to select relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. We evaluate our proposed model using real world traffic datasets and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Due to the advances of intelligent transportation system (ITSs), traffic forecasting has gained significant interest as robust traffic prediction acts as an important part in different ITSs namely traffic signal control, navigation, route mapping, etc. The traffic prediction model aims to predict the traffic conditions based on the past traffic data. For more accurate traffic prediction, this study proposes an optimal deep learning-enabled statistical analysis model. This study offers the design of optimal convolutional neural network with attention long short term memory (OCNN-ALSTM) model for traffic prediction. The proposed OCNN-ALSTM technique primarily preprocesses the traffic data by the use of min-max normalization technique. Besides, OCNN-ALSTM technique was executed for classifying and predicting the traffic data in real time cases. For enhancing the predictive outcomes of the OCNN-ALSTM technique, the bird swarm algorithm (BSA) is employed to it and thereby overall efficacy of the network gets improved. The design of BSA for optimal hyperparameter tuning of the CNN-ALSTM model shows the novelty of the work. The experimental validation of the OCNNALSTM technique is performed using benchmark datasets and the results are examined under several aspects. The simulation results reported the enhanced outcomes of theOCNN-ALSTMmodel over the recentmethods under several dimensions. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is the key problem of intelligent transportation system. Accurate prediction results are indispensable for traffic management and road planning. However, due to the complex spatial-temporal correlation of traffic flow data, including the spatial correlation and temporal correlation of adjacency, periodicity, and trend that exist between different roads. The existing forecasting methods consider the spatial-temporal correlation but lack the dynamic modeling of spatial-temporal correlation. To deal with this dynamic feature, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional attention-based spatial-temporal network (MA-STN). It mainly contains three parts, the spatial-temporal attention unit, the spatial-temporal feature extraction unit based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the fusion prediction unit, and the residual connection is also added to the model to avoid the gradient disappearance problem. Meanwhile, this paper divides the dataset into three subsets to deal with the three features in the temporal dimension separately. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, two real-world road traffic flow data collected by PeMS system are used for validation. By comparing six different models, the proposed network in this paper has a 7% accuracy improvement compared to the baseline model. To verify the effectiveness of the attention mechanism, ablation experiments are used in this paper for validation, and the results show that the attention mechanism can achieve a 5% accuracy improvement.  © 2022 Guangxia Xu and Xinting Hu.

AB  - As a typical spatiotemporal problem, there are three main challenges in traffic forecasting. First, the road network is a nonregular topology, and it is difficult to extract complex spatial dependence accurately. Second, there are short-and long-term dependencies between traffic dates. Third, there are many other factors besides the influence of spatiotemporal dependence, such as semantic characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a spatiotemporal DeepWalk gated recurrent unit model (ST-DWGRU), a deep learning framework that fuses spatial, temporal, and semantic features for traffic speed forecasting. In the framework, the spatial dependency between nodes of an entire road network is extracted by graph convolutional network (GCN), whereas the temporal dependency between speeds is captured by a gated recurrent unit network (GRU). DeepWalk is used to extract semantic information from road networks. Three publicly available datasets with different time granularities of 15, 30, and 60 min are used to validate the short-and long-time prediction effect of this model. The results show that the ST-DWGRU model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.  © 2022 Jian Yang et al.

AB  - The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods, such as autoregressive or spatio-temporal models, is often extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance, particularly by midnight (called ‘next-day morning traffic prediction’ thereafter). In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as a probing method to understand the impacts of people's work and rest patterns in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic. The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides, people's tweeting activities in the night before and early morning (by 5am) are statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning commute congestion using people's tweeting profiles extracted by 5am. In most cases, the tweet information collected by the midnight before is sufficient to make good prediction for next-day morning traffic. The Pittsburgh study supports that this framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion variation, while its prediction performance being no worse than baseline methods on other roads. Through experiments, we demonstrate our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights. The proposed social media empowered framework can be a promising tool for real-time traffic management and potentially extended for traffic prediction at other times of day. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Traffic forecasting provides the foundational guidance for many typical applications in the smart city management, such as urban traffic control, congestion avoidance, and navigation guidance. Many researchers have focused on the spatio-temporal correlations under fixed topology structure in traffic network to improve the traffic forecasting accuracy. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches are not completely discussed that the association relationship among traffic network nodes are not invariable under different traffic conditions. In this paper, a novel traffic forecasting framework is proposed by integrating the dynamic association of traffic nodes with the spatio-temporal deep learning model. To be specific, an adaptive subgraph reformulation algorithm is designed first based on the specific forecasting interval to reduce the interference of irrelevant spatio-temporal information. After that, by enhancing the attention mechanism with the generative decoder, a spatio-temporal deep learning model with only one forward operation is proposed to avoid the degradation of accuracy in the long-term prediction, in which the spatio-temporal information and the external factors (such as weather and holiday) are fused together to be as an input vector. Based on the reformulated subgraph constructed of traffic nodes with closer spatio-temporal correlation, experiments show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms other GNN (Graph Neural Network)-based state-of-the-art baselines for various forecasting intervals on a real-world dataset. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecast is a key task for planning transport infrastructure and real-time optimisation of traffic in large cities. The models used in professional literature usually provide accurate forecasts, but in case of congestion, forecasts can be highly inaccurate. At the heart of these situations are complex processes taking place on the road network of the city, which the prediction models are rarely prepared for. The congestion phenomena propagating on the road network of large cities have a major impact on the development of traffic patterns. In this article, we present a new traffic prediction model, the Congestion-based Traffic Prediction Model (CTPM), which refines previous forecasts based on congestion propagation patterns. Our aim is to show that using congestion data can greatly improve our forecasts. The developed model can be used in conjunction with any previous model, so there is no need to replace well-functioning methods. To the best of our knowledge, no method has yet been developed that takes traffic information into account for forecasting in such a way. Our performance studies have shown that by using CTPM we were able to refine traffic forecasts by an average of 9.76%. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - In an intelligent transportation system, the key problem of traffic forecasting is how to extract periodic temporal dependencies and complex spatial correlations. Current state-of-the-art methods for predicting traffic flow are based on graph architectures and sequence learning models, but they do not fully exploit dynamic spatial-temporal information in the traffic system. Specifically, the temporal dependencies in the short-range are diluted by recurrent neural networks. Moreover, local spatial information is also ignored by existing sequence models, because their convolution operation uses global average pooling. Besides, accidents may occur during object transition, which will cause congestion in the real world and further decrease prediction accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose Spatial-Temporal Conv-sequence Learning (STCL), where a focused temporal block uses unidirectional convolution to capture short-term periodic temporal dependencies effectively, and a spatial-temporal fusion module is responsible for extracting dependencies of interactions and decreasing the feature dimensions. Moreover, as the accidents features have an impact on local traffic congestion, we employ position encoding to detect anomalies in complex traffic situations. We have conducted a large number of experiments on real-world tasks and verified the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep learning models are not yet fully applied to fluid dynamics predictions, while they are the state-of-the-art solution in many other areas i.e. video and language processing, finance, robotics. Prediction problems on high-dimensional, complex dynamical systems require deep learning models devised to avoid overfitting while maintaining the required model complexity. In this work we present a deep learning prediction model based on a combination of 3D convolutional layers and a low-dimensional intermediate representation that is specifically designed to forecast the future states of this type of dynamical systems. The model predicts p future velocity-field time-slices (samples) based on k past samples from a training dataset consisting of a synthetic jet in transitional regime. The complexity of this flow is characterized by two topology patterns that are periodically changing, making this flow as a suitable example to test the performance of deep learning models to predict time states in complex flows. Moreover, the wide number of applications of synthetic jets (i.e.: fluid mixing, heat transfer enhancement, flow control), points out this example as a reference for future applications, where modeling synthetic jet flows with a reduced computational effort is needed. This work additionally opens up research opportunities for other areas that also operate with complex and high-dimensional time-series data: future frame video prediction, network traffic forecasting, network intrusion detection. The proposed model is presented in detail. A comprehensive analysis of the results is provided. The results are based on a strict validation strategy to ensure its generalization. The model offers an average symmetric mean absolute error (sMAPE) and a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 1.068 and 0.026 respectively (one order of magnitude improvement over low-rank approximation tools), using 10 past samples and predicting 6 future samples of a two-dimensional velocity field on a 70x50 point matrix associated to a synthetic jet dataset. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The article presents a new approach to building a passenger rail traffic generation model. It uses data on the number of passengers at stations and railway stops obtained from the databases of operators on the rail transport market through the Office of Rail Transport – market regulator – combined with data on the model of the area around the station built based on population, number of beds, individual motorization and gross domestic product (GDP). This enabled analyzing the potential of railway traffic generation at a very detailed level. The article presents a methodology for building a passenger rail traffic generation model and verification of this model based on limited variables describing railway stations and stops as well as traffic zones and available statistical data. The model takes into account three segments of the railway market: regional, interregional and inter-agglomeration transport. The results of these analyzes can be used to increase the accuracy and the reliability of rail traffic models used in the analysis of transport networks. © 2022. Andrzej Brzeziński, Andrzej Waltz.

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting is challenging, owing to the complex spatial dependence of traffic networks and the dynamic time dependence of traffic patterns. In this study, a novel spatiotemporal fuzzy-graph convolutional network model with dynamic feature encoding is proposed to realize accurate traffic forecasting. The proposed model combines graph convolutional network and long short-term memory network to extract complicated spatiotemporal dependence features of traffic data. Furthermore, a new graph generation method based on the fuzzy C-means clustering is designed to enhance the representation ability of the spatial dependencies between stations in a traffic network. Moreover, to make the graph convolutional network fully consider both global and local spatiotemporal dependency relationship between the stations in the process of convolution operation, a new node feature construction method is proposed. Finally, the forecasting performance of the proposed model is verified on three real-world traffic datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models in terms of both spatiotemporal feature extraction and long short-term forecasting. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Spatial-temporal graph modeling plays an important role in the fields of transportation, meteorology, and social networks. Traffic flow prediction is a classic spatial-temporal modeling task. Existing methods usually do not take into account the asynchronous spatial-temporal correlation in traffic data. In addition, due to the complexity and variability of traffic data, long-term traffic forecasting is highly challenging. In order to solve the above problems, this article proposes a new deep learning-based asynchronous dilation graph convolution network (ADGCN) to model the spatial-temporal graphs. We mine the asynchronous spatial-temporal correlation in the traffic network, and propose the asynchronous spatial-temporal graph convolution (ASTGC) operation to extract this special relationship. Furthermore, we extend the dilated 1-D causal convolution to a graph convolution. The receptive field of the model increases exponentially with the increase of the network depth. Experiments are conducted on three public traffic data sets, and the results show that the prediction performance of ADGCN is better than the existing counterpart methods, especially in long-term prediction tasks.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, there has been an increasing need for new applications and services such as big data, blockchains, vehicle-to-everything (V2X), the Internet of things, 5G, and beyond. Therefore, to maintain quality of service (QoS), accurate network resource planning and forecasting are essential steps for resource allocation. This study proposes a reliable hybrid dynamic bandwidth slice forecasting framework that combines the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and local smoothing methods to improve the network forecasting model. Moreover, the proposed framework can dynamically react to all the changes occurring in the data series. Backbone traffic was used to validate the proposed method. As a result, the forecasting accuracy improved significantly with the proposed framework and with minimal data loss from the smoothing process. The results showed that the hybrid moving average LSTM (MLSTM) achieved the most remarkable improvement in the training and testing forecasts, with 28% and 24% for long-term evolution (LTE) time series and with 35% and 32% for the multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) time series, respectively, while robust locally weighted scatter plot smoothing and LSTM (RLWLSTM) achieved the most significant improvement for upstream traffic with 45%; moreover, the dynamic learning framework achieved improvement percentages that can reach up to 100%. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Intelligent transportation systems are a key component in smart cities, and the estimation and prediction of the spatiotemporal traffic state is critical to capture the dynamics of traffic congestion, i.e., its generation, propagation and mitigation, in order to increase operational efficiency and improve livability within smart cities. And while spatiotemporal data related to traffic is becoming common place due to the wide availability of cheap sensors and the rapid deployment of IoT platforms, the data still suffer some challenges related to sparsity, incompleteness, and noise which makes the traffic analytics difficult. In this article, we investigate the problem of missing data or noisy information in the context of real-time monitoring and forecasting of traffic congestion for road networks in a city. The road network is represented as a directed graph in which nodes are junctions (intersections) and edges are road segments. We assume that the city has deployed high-fidelity sensors for speed reading in a subset of edges; and the objective is to infer the speed readings for the remaining edges in the network; and to estimate the missing values in the segments for which sensors have stopped generating data due to technical problems (e.g., battery, network, etc.). We propose a tensor representation for the series of road network snapshots, and develop a regularized factorization method to estimate the missing values, while learning the latent factors of the network. The regularizer, which incorporates spatial properties of the road network, improves the quality of the results. The learned factors, with a graph-based temporal dependency, are then used in an autoregressive algorithm to predict the future state of the road network with a large horizon. Extensive numerical experiments with real traffic data from the cities of Doha (Qatar) and Aarhus (Denmark) demonstrate that the proposed approach is appropriate for imputing the missing data and predicting the traffic state. It is accurate and efficient and can easily be applied to other traffic datasets. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - As one of the most important applications of industrial Internet of Things, intelligent transportation system aims to improve the efficiency and safety of transportation networks. In this article, we propose a novel Bayesian framework entitled variational graph recurrent attention neural networks (VGRAN) for robust traffic forecasting. It captures time-varying road-sensor readings through dynamic graph convolution operations and is capable of learning latent variables regarding the sensor representation and traffic sequences. The proposed probabilistic method is a more flexible generative model considering the stochasticity of sensor attributes and temporal traffic correlations. Moreover, it enables efficient variational inference and faithful modeling of implicit posteriors of traffic data, which are usually irregular, spatial correlated, and multiple temporal dependents. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed VGRAN model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while capturing innate ambiguity of the predicted results.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - For station-based bike-sharing systems, the balance between user demand and bike allocation is critical for the operation. As a basic operational index, the short-term prediction of bike numbers (flow) plays an important role in demand forecasting and rebalancing resources of bike-sharing networks. Many different methods have been proposed for bike forecast in recent years, and the deep learning (DL)-based models have dominated this area because of their competitive performance. However, there still exist challenges in such approaches including: (i) how to appropriately select the training input for the DL model, and (ii) how to effectively utilize both the temporal and spatial features in the data for prediction. In particular, the arbitrary input may limit the model optimization, and the separate consideration of temporal and spatial features could change the original data representation. This paper uses a simple autocorrelation function to select the best input candidates and develops a three-dimensional (3 D) residual neural network to learn spatiotemporal features simultaneously. The proposed DL model is trained and validated using two separate bike-sharing datasets from New York and Suzhou cities. The learned features by two-dimensional (2 D) and 3 D CNN kernels under different input methods are compared. Results show that 3 D CNN outperforms other models and that the proposed input selection method yields better learning results for both datasets. The proposed methods help with a comprehensive DL model workflow and better forecasting accuracy. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study investigated whether indices for socioeconomic, demographic and urban form characteristics can reflect the overall effect of each category in a demand forecasting model. Regression equations were developed for trip generation of the land use of long day care centres (LDCC) in the metropolitan region of Hobart, Australia, to estimate the morning peak hourly private car trip generation of the centres. The independent variables for the model were functions of socioeconomic, demographic and urban form related indices, while the dependent variable was private car trip generation per number of staff or children. Findings show that using indices for socioeconomic, demographic and urban form characteristics enhances overall model performance, while the models based on the commonly used method for estimating trip generation present acceptable results in just some specific sites. The use of socioeconomic, demographic and urban form indices can reflect differences in these characteristics across suburbs when estimating trip generation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Vehicle travel paths provide basic information for improving traffic forecasting models, tracking epidemics transmission, and road construction. Nevertheless, the challenge of recognition and verification still exists, especially in urban dense road networks. This paper proposes a vehicle path recognition model combined with mobile phone data. In path fitting module, the spatio-temporal density-based clustering algorithm and Gaussian filter were combined to smooth the position fluctuations of mobile phone data; then non-uniform rational B-splines were used to fit travel paths. In path recognition module, the modified probabilistic map matching algorithm was used to match fitting knots to road networks; then matching results were repaired considering the road network topology and the direction angles. The results were verified from trip lengths, urban environments, and road categories. The recognition accuracy was around 90%, 24.22% higher than that of existing methods. The error rate was around 6%, 30.28% lower than that of existing methods. © 2021 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

AB  - The demand of wireless access users is increasing explosively. The 5G network traffic is increasing exponentially and showing a trend of diversity and heterogeneity, which makes network traffic forecasting face many challenges. By studying the actual performance of the 5G network, this paper makes an accurate prediction of the 5G network and builds a smoothed long short-Term memory (SLSTM) traffic prediction model. The model updates the number of layers and hidden units according to the prediction accuracy adaptive mechanism. At the same time, in order to reduce the randomness of the 5G traffic sequence, the output feature sequence of the original time series is stabilized by the seasonal time difference method. In the experiments, the prediction results of the proposed algorithm are compared with those of the traditional algorithms. The results show that the SLSTM algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of 5G traffic prediction. The model can be used for 5G traffic prediction for decision-making. © 2022 Zihang Gao.

AB  - Urban traffic flow forecasting is a critical issue in intelligent transportation systems. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of urban road conditions, how to capture the dynamic spatiotemporal correlation and make accurate predictions is very challenging. In most of existing works, urban road network is often modeled as a fixed graph based on local proximity. However, such modeling is not sufficient to describe the dynamics of the road network and capture the global contextual information. In this paper, we consider constructing the road network as a dynamic weighted graph through attention mechanism. Furthermore, we propose to seek both spatial neighbors and semantic neighbors to make more connections between road nodes. We propose a novel Spatiotemporal Adaptive Gated Graph Convolution Network (STAG-GCN) to predict traffic conditions for several time steps ahead. STAG-GCN mainly consists of two major components: (1) multivariate self-attention Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) is utilized to capture local and long-range temporal dependencies across recent, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic observations; (2) mix-hop AG-GCN extracts selective spatial and semantic dependencies within multi-layer stacking through adaptive graph gating mechanism and mix-hop propagation mechanism. The output of different components are weighted fused to generate the final prediction results. Extensive experiments on two real-world large scale urban traffic dataset have verified the effectiveness, and the multi-step forecasting performance of our proposed models outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Traffic forecasting plays an important role of modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). With the recent rapid advancement in deep learning, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an emerging research issue for improving the traffic forecasting problem. Specifically, one of the main types of GNNs is the spatial-temporal GNN (ST-GNN), which has been applied to various time-series forecasting applications. This study aims to provide an overview of recent ST-GNN models for traffic forecasting. Particularly, we propose a new taxonomy of ST-GNN by dividing existing models into four approaches such as graph convolutional recurrent neural network, fully graph convolutional network, graph multi-attention network, and self-learning graph structure. Sequentially, we present experimental results based on the reconstruction of representative models using selected benchmark datasets to evaluate the main contributions of the key components in each type of ST-GNN. Finally, we discuss several open research issues for further investigations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Travel time is an important signal to measure the performance of transportation systems. However, urban traffic forecasting is still a challenging task due to the complicated nonlinear nature of urban traffic and the impact of abnormal traffic event. In this study, we propose a flexible deep learning-aware framework which is composed by integrating multiple components with a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model as the main body. Specifically, we incorporate a newly designed hybrid adjacency matrix of graph convolution network and temporal attention mechanism to flexibly capture spatio-temporal dynamics accordingly. In addition, we design a responsive algorithm to obtain the latent representation of traffic event by applying stacked denoising autoencoder. We then conduct the baseline model comparison and ablation experiments to evaluate our model performance with real-word datasets. The results indicate that our method outperforms baselines and the fusion of traffic event data can improve prediction accuracy. Moreover, the case study and sensitivity analysis also have a reference value to the practical application of traffic prediction task. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wireless networks are used extensively in communication technologies. From Tesla to date researchers, many are working on wireless data transmission techniques and technologies. Despite the immense progressions over the past decade, there are precise hurdles that the industry endures to face. Bandwidth restrictions, latency problems, and device compatibility issues prevent the viewer from meeting seamless data transmissions. Many devices used for communication are used with the wireless interface and are proficient in transmitting data efficiently to the communication range. The growth in data communication requirements increases the network traffic and results in a network bottleneck. There are more challenges for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) due to the additional overhead of resource constraints. Congestion leads to depletion of the node's energy, deterioration of network performance, and increased network latency and packet loss. As a result, energy-efficient and reliable state-of-the-art congestion control protocols must be designed to detect, notify and control congestion effectively. To minimize the packet loss in MANETs using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), we proposed a data loss minimization technique (DLMT). Results show that enhanced DLMT outperforms by 18% compared to state-of-the-art proven congestion control mechanisms. DLMT improves the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints and improves performance by reducing the delay in better throughput, which can be seen by analyzing experimental results. The proposed coordination process's scalability and robustness are shown in good agreement with simulation results and analytic results for the stochastic model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic forecasters may find value in expressing the uncertainty of their forecasts as a range of expected outcomes. Traditional methods for estimating such uncertainty windows rely on assumptions about reasonable ranges of travel demand forecasting model inputs and parameters. Rather than relying on assumptions, we demonstrate how to use empirical measures of past forecast accuracy to estimate the uncertainty in future forecasts. We develop an econometric framework based on quantile regression to estimate an expected (median) traffic volume as a function of the forecast, and a range within which we expect 90% of traffic volumes to fall. Using data on observed versus forecast traffic for 3912 observations from 1291 road projects, we apply this framework to estimate a model of overall uncertainty and a full model that considers the effect of project attributes. Our results show that the median post-opening traffic is 6% lower than forecast. The expected range of outcomes varies significantly with the forecast volume, the forecast method, the project type, the functional class, the time span and the unemployment rate at the time forecast is made. For example, consider a 5-year forecast for an existing arterial roadway made in 2019 when the state unemployment rate was 4% using a travel model. If a travel model predicted 30,000 Average Daily Traffic (ADT) on this road, our results suggest that 90% of future traffic volumes would fall between 19,000 and 36,000 ADT. A forecaster can apply the resulting equations to calculate an uncertainty window for their project, or they can estimate new quantile regression equations from locally collected forecast accuracy data. Aided by decision intervals, such uncertainty windows can help planners determine whether a forecast deviation would change a project decision. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Researchers have improved travel demand forecasting methods in recent decades but invested relatively little to understand their accuracy. A major barrier has been the lack of necessary data. We compiled the largest known database of traffic forecast accuracy, composed of forecast traffic, post-opening counts and project attributes for 1291 road projects in the United States and Europe. We compared measured versus forecast traffic and identified the factors associated with accuracy. We found measured traffic is on average 6% lower than forecast volumes, with a mean absolute deviation of 17% from the forecast. Higher volume roads, higher functional classes, shorter time spans, and the use of travel models all improved accuracy. Unemployment rates also affected accuracy—traffic would be 1% greater than forecast on average, rather than 6% lower, if we adjust for higher unemployment during the post-recession years (2008 to 2014). Forecast accuracy was not consistent over time: more recent forecasts were more accurate, and the mean deviation changed direction. Traffic on projects that opened from the 1980s through early 2000s was higher on average than forecast, while traffic on more recent projects was lower on average than forecast. This research provides insight into the degree of confidence that planners and policy makers can expect from traffic forecasts and suggests that we should view forecasts as a range of possible outcomes rather than a single expected outcome. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The financial crisis that beset the Republic of Korea in late 1997 had a tremendous impact on the nation's economy. In an effort to resolve the fundamental causes of this crisis, one fiscal reform, executed with the goal of improving the efficacy of government investment, was the introduction of the Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS). PFS was initiated to determine which projects to fund in a transparent and fair way through preliminarily examinations and evaluation of the feasibility of large-scale government projects. This study assesses the achievements of PFS by investigating improvements in the accuracy of traffic forecasting results and analyzing the determinants of traffic forecasting errors in PFS. The traffic forecasting data include 42 road projects for which PFS were conducted and 113 road projects that were not subject to PFS and for which forecasts and actual out-turns were available. The results reveal that 41.3% of traffic forecasts were overestimated before the introduction of PFS. This statistic contrasts with the traffic forecasting error rate of 14.53% since PFS became mandatory. Moreover, traffic forecasts of PFS projects were also unbiased. By analyzing the determinants of traffic forecasting errors in PFS projects using the random forest approach, we also found that the characteristics of the project manager and forecaster, and the influence of politicians or political groups, had minimal effect on traffic forecasting errors. We conclude that PFS enhances the accuracy of traffic forecasts and prevents the initiation of inefficient transportation projects. Our study fills a gap in the existing literature because few studies have focused on the various factors affecting traffic forecasting error based on data and econometrics. This study also examines the effects of policy measures to mitigate overestimation and increase traffic forecasting accuracy. Our results emphasize the significant role of analysts, the need for credible guidelines and an independent evaluation institution, and the importance of a robust governance system in public investment management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Several prediction methods currently help companies improve efficiency, one of which is the prediction of bandwidth allocation. This method is expected to support a telecommunications company in carrying out cost efficiency, especially the data transfer cost from each location. Currently, the problem with telecommunication companies is the lack of management of the amount of bandwidth required. Sometimes, there is a lack or excess of bandwidth allocation in each BTS, so that this problem can reduce the profits earned by the company. From these problems, we need a system that can regulate and predict future bandwidth requirements. So in this study, we explore the prediction of bandwidth needs by utilizing the data from monitoring the bandwidth of each cell in the form of time-series data. Researchers collect the data from November 2019 to January 2020; our first step is to simulate predictions using the ARIMA method. In this study, simulations using a combined method of ARIMA and LSTM RNN. After trying several ARIMA and LSTM models, the best models are ARIMA (0.0 .6) and LSTM (windows = 100, 2 Layer, 100 Neuron), where the RMSE results obtained are 387.693019. From the results of the model, the researcher conducted an experiment using the Hybrid ARIMA LTSM model. The findings of this study indicate that predictions within 50 hours indicate an accurate level of accuracy.  ©2021 Seventh Sense Research Group .

AB  - Accurate mobile traffic prediction at city-scale is becoming increasingly important as data demand surges and network deployments become denser. How mobile networks and user mobility are modelled is key to high-quality forecasts. Prior work builds on distance-based Euclidean (grids) or invariant graph representations, which cannot capture dynamic spatiotemporal correlations with high fidelity. In this letter we propose SDGNet, a handover-aware spatiotemporal graph neural network that hinges on Dynamic Graph Convolution and Gated Linear Units to predict traffic consumption over short, medium and long time-frames. Experiments with a real-world dataset demonstrate SDGNet outperforms state-of-the-art neural model, attaining up to 4× lower prediction errors.  © 1997-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate and real-time traffic flow forecasting plays an important role in optimizing traffic routing enabling adaptive and sophisticated applications on the network. Managing and routing enormous traffic flow with dynamic behavior is a highly challenging task. However, arriving at a precise model for traffic forecasting in a short interval of time is not trivial because of the dynamic nature of traffic flow. A novel multivariate time series framework is designed to analyze and forecast the dynamic traffic flow in SDN based networks. The proposed framework adapts the Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (MSSA) forecasting model and incorporates the Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to improve the accuracy of flow prediction. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MSSA method. The proposed method predicts the long-term traffic fluctuation from the observed traffic traces. The SDN controller is trained using the traffic traces and future traffic flows are forecasted. The performance evaluation of the proposed method predicts real-time traffic trends accurately with 2.2% MAPE, 9.44 MAE and 13.803 RMSE. The results show that the learning ability of MSSA helps to forecast future network traffic with low prediction errors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In today's scenario the number of mobile devices is increasing by leaps and bounds and hence the networks are highly congested. To use the existing networks efficiently, the insight into the amount of traffic beforehand, would be highly beneficial. Mobile traffic forecasting would enable Software Defined Mobile Network (SDMN) to use network resources and bandwidth effectively. Therefore, this paper aims to forecast mobile traffic for SDMN using nature-inspired​ optimization techniques. The data taken is captured using Wireshark. In order to accurately predict network traffic, this paper considers Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) function estimation based training model with Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The proposed technique increases the probability of global search by optimizing kernel parameters namely, regularization and kernel width. The parameters: Mean Square Error (MSE), True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR),​ accuracy and precision are evaluated for the proposed optimization algorithm. The results of the proposed algorithm Least Square Support Vector Machine-Enhanced Whale Optimization Algorithm (LSSVM-EWOA) for traffic forecasting are compared with Least Square Support Vector Machine-Whale Optimization Algorithm (LSSVM-WOA). The accuracy of prediction of the proposed model is 98.10%, which confirmed the effectiveness and the actual use of the proposed model. © 2021 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS)

AB  - Traffic prediction is necessary for management departments to dispatch vehicles and for drivers to avoid congested roads. Many traffic forecasting methods based on deep learning have been proposed in recent years, and their main aim is to solve the problem of spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. This paper proposes a useful dynamic model to predict the urban traffic volume by combining fully bidirectional LSTM, a complex attention mechanism, and external features, including weather conditions and events. First, we adopt bidirectional LSTM to obtain temporal dependencies of traffic volume dynamically in each layer, which is different from the hybrid methods combining bidirectional and unidirectional approaches. Second, we use a more elaborate attention mechanism to learn short-term and long-term periodic temporal dependencies. Finally, we collect weather condition and event information as external features to further improve the prediction precision. The experimental results show that the proposed model improves the prediction precision by approximately 3-7 percent on the NYC-Taxi and NYC-Bike datasets compared to the most recently developed method and is therefore a useful tool for urban traffic prediction. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - When it comes to decreasing traffic congestion and enhancing mobility, traffic forecasting is critical. However, due to the complicated spatio-temporal dynamics of urban transportation networks, which are difficult to describe, this task is tough. Using a model predictive controller (MPC) provides the control of a traffic network's architecture as well as errors in its operations. Based on a real-time simulation, a novel, accurate prediction controller for urban traffic was presented in this study to estimate the number of cars at junctions and their waiting duration. Different optimization approaches were employed and evaluated to improve the MPC's performance. Simulation results demonstrated that the fmincon was very robust and could effectively reduce the number of vehicles in the link, in comparison with other algorithms This study also includes an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of various prediction horizon sets in an MPC. By increasing the prediction horizon, the amplitude of fluctuation became more important, but when Np=4, the fluctuations reduced. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Forecasting road flow has strong importance for both allowing authorities to guarantee safety conditions and traffic efficiency, as well as for road users to be able to plan their trips according to space and road occupation. In a summer resort, such as beaches near cities, traffic depends directly on weather conditions, variables that should be of great impact on the quality of forecasts. Will the use of a dataset with information on transit flows enhanced with meteorological information allow the construction of a precise traffic flow forecasting model, allowing predictions to be made in advance of the traffic flow in suitable time? The present work evaluates different machine learning methods, namely long short-term memory, autoregressive LSTM, and a convolutional neural network, and data attributes to predict traffic flows based on radar and meteorological sensor information. The models trained to predict the traffic flow have shown that weather conditions were essential for this forecast, and thus, these variables were employed in the evaluated deep-learning models. The results pointed out that it is possible to forecast the traffic flow at a reasonable error level for one-hour periods, and the CNN model presented the lowest prediction error values and consumed the least time to build its predictions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - A precise knowledge about future traffic will eventually open a new era in traffic management. Research has focused on the still unresolved problem of predicting travel time (TT). However, practitioners favor the level of service (LOS) as a meaningful metric that avoids the continuous fluctuations and link-specificity of TT. Evolving from TT to LOS opens a new research line in the field, moving the underlying mathematical problem from regression to classification. This study proposes a short-term LOS classifier to fulfill this requirement. Given that traffic conditions are mostly free-flow throughout the day, LOS classes are unbalanced. Therefore, we based our predictor on a Random Undersampling Boost algorithm (RUSBoost), especially suited to overcome this issue. We trained and validated this LOS predictor with 12 months of arrival travel time data, captured by a Bluetooth network with 6 links, in real operation on the SE-30 highway (Seville, Spain). This classifier achieved an average recall of 82.8% for prediction horizons up to 15 minutes, reaching 92.5% predicting congestion. We reached this performance by exploiting two facts that we empirically demonstrated: (i) information from every link (even those in the opposite direction) contributes to increase the accuracy of the prediction; and (ii) traffic presents different behavior depending on the day of the week, which we used to segment the data and construct specific classifiers. These promising results show the potential of the proposed LOS predictor, providing a new perspective into traffic forecast and the subsequent traffic management that yields with what practitioners demand.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Intelligent traffic management is an important issue for smart cities. City councils try to implement the newest techniques and performant technologies in order to avoid traffic congestion, to optimize the use of traffic lights, to efficiently use car parking, etc. To find the best solution to this problem, Birmingham City Council decided to allow open-source predictive traffic forecasting by making the real-time datasets available. This paper proposes a multi-agent system (MAS) approach for intelligent urban traffic management in Birmingham using forecasting and classification techniques. The designed agents have the following tasks: forecast the occupancy rates for traffic flow, road junctions and car parking; classify the faults; control and monitor the entire process. The experimental results show that k-nearest neighbor forecasts with high accuracy rates for the traffic data and decision trees build the most accurate model for classifying the faults for their detection and repair in the shortest possible time. The whole learning process is coordinated by a monitoring agent in order to automate Birmingham city’s traffic management. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The rapidly increasing data demand from current Internet services, such as cloud computing and high-quality video streaming, is raising the pressure on network operators to provide reliable high-speed connections while keeping costs low. Without having to rely on the bandwidth expansion of optical waveguides or modulation level efficiency, one of the ways to increase spectral efficiency of a network is by the optimal utilization of already existing resources. For elastic optical networks (EON) this can be solved by the Routing, Modulation and Spectrum Assignment (RMSA). However, another problem arises, due to the nature of computer network traffic, that makes it difficult to assess the longevity of physical components and to plan a network to serve a maximum amount of bandwidth demand for predetermined time span. To help alleviating these problems, this paper presents an investigation of a novel technique for resource planning and consume estimation based on simulations. First, traffic matrix prediction is made using recurrent neural networks (RNN), and then simulations are ran to estimate the consumed bandwidth for a point in time. For the traffic forecasting, real traffic data has been used to train the RNN, obtained from an anonymous dataset containing the traffic history of the ABILENE and GEANT networks from the years 2004–2005, which is a relatively recent available dataset. Furthermore, heuristic algorithms are proposed to apply the RMSA to the predicted traffic, in a quasi-optimal manner, in order to minimize the use of network resources for future traffic, by releasing available capacity in the existing optical fiber links in an incremental traffic approach. The results show that the proposed RNN models are indeed capable of predicting the traffic matrices a month ahead, with low mean squared error. RMSA simulations were also performed using heuristics in order to estimate the consumed bandwidth in the context of EON networks, revealing that, for the proposed heuristics, the results favor the shortest path routing heuristic over the load balancing heuristic for a long-term bandwidth open capacity maximization and better resource savings. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Accurate traffic forecasting on citywide networks is one of the crucial urban data mining applications that accurately provide congestion warning and transportation scheduling. While previous work has made significant efforts to learn traffic temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies, two key limitations exist in current models: (1) most existing approaches solely capture spatial correlations among neighbors on predefined graph structure, and genuine relation may be missing due to the incomplete graph connections; and (2) existing methods are defective to capture the temporal trends because the recurrent and stacking structure employed in these methods suffers from the long-range temporal dependency vanquish problem. To overcome the difficulty in multistep prediction and further capture the dynamic spatialoral dependencies of traffic flows, we propose a new traffic speed prediction framework for multiscale graph attention networks (MS-GATNs). In particular, MS-GATNs is a hierarchically structured graph neural architecture that learns not only the local region-wise geographical dependencies but also the spatial semantics from a global perspective. Furthermore, a multiheads attention mechanism is introduced to empower our model with the capability of capturing complex nonstationary temporal dynamics. Experiments on real-world traffic data sets demonstrate that MS-GATNs outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in long-term forecasting. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The use of new information and communication technologies is an important aid to solving transportation problems. This is commonly known as ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) that can provide effective information for travelers and traffic managers. Road traffic prediction has led to a growing research area debated by several researchers affiliated to a range of disciplines. Recently, a significant amount of research efforts has been devoted to deep learning methods, greatly advancing traffic prediction abilities. The purpose of this paper is to meet a practical need: forecasting highway traffic volume by payment method (manual/electronic toll) over a long time horizon based on historical observations. A variety of methods were used to make this forecast, and the results were compared and interpreted to identify model limitations and improve the approach. We propose to forecast daily highway traffic using four methods: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with additional lagged values (SARIMAX), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and at least we perform combination method which has been shown to be efficient in the literature and which, applied to our real case study, will confirm these performances. Indeed, the best prediction results were obtained using the hybridization CNN-LSTM which reached an R-squared value of 95%. In the present study, such an effort resulted in considerable improvement in long terme forecasting accuracy when compared with the existing models' performance previously adopted in the field of traffic forecasting. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.

AB  - This work proposed an integrated model combining bagging and stacking considering the weight coefficient for short-time traffic-flow prediction, which incorporates vacation and peak time features, as well as occupancy and speed information, in order to improve prediction accuracy and accomplish deeper traffic flow data feature mining. To address the limitations of a single prediction model in traffic forecasting, a stacking model with ridge regression as the meta-learner is first established, then the stacking model is optimized from the perspective of the learner using the bagging model, and lastly the optimized learner is embedded into the stacking model as the new base learner to obtain the Ba-stacking model. Finally, to address the Ba-stacking model’s shortcom-ings in terms of low base learner utilization, the information structure of the base learners is modi-fied by weighting the error coefficients while taking into account the model’s external features, re-sulting in a DW-Ba-stacking model that can change the weights of the base learners to adjust the feature distribution and thus improve utilization. Using 76,896 data from the I5NB highway as the empirical study object, the DW-Ba-Stacking model is compared and assessed with the traditional model in this paper. The empirical results show that the DW-Ba-stacking model has the highest prediction accuracy, demonstrating that the model is successful in predicting short-term traffic flows and can effectively solve traffic-congestion problems. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In traffic systems, traffic forecasting is a critical issue, which has attracted much interest from researchers. It is a challenging task due to the complex spatial-temporal patterns of traffic data. Previous works focus on designing complex graph-based neural networks to model spatial-temporal dependencies from data. By using graphs to represent road networks, these works capture spatial patterns with graph convolutions. However, graphs cannot fully represent spatial relations from road networks. It limits the performance of graph-based methods. In this paper, we propose a directed hypergraph neural network architecture, Directed Hypergraph Attention Network(DHAT), for traffic forecasting. Unlike previous works, DHAT introduces a directed hypergraph to represent road networks. Compared with graphs, directed hypergraphs could represent spatial information from graphs and outperform them in modeling complex directed relations among multiple nodes. Based on the directed hypergraph, a directed hypergraph convolution is proposed to exploit spatial relations among traffic series. By combining the proposed convolution and attention mechanisms, DHAT can effectively achieve promising predictions for traffic forecasting. To evaluate the performance of DHAT, we have conducted extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets. Compared with other baselines, experimental results show that DHAT reduces Mean Absolute Error by 0.03–0.64 on these datasets. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Traffic forecasting has been extensively studied due to its importance for the design and development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Most of the existing relevant literature focuses, almost exclusively, on the effectiveness of the traffic forecasting models, while neglecting the importance of computational efficiency. However, the need for faster models becomes increasingly urgent as the volume of available traffic data increases. In this paper, an effective and efficient model for large-scale multi-step traffic forecasting is presented. In particular, the classic autoregressive model is reformulated based on the idea that not all past traffic values are important for predicting future traffic values, and thus only some of them should be taken into account in the forecasting process. The selection of the appropriate past values is performed by the application of an eligibility criterion, controlled by a respective hyperparameter and its value is optimized using an efficient cluster-based method. The overall modelling approach leads to a sparse least squares problem, which is efficiently solved using a novel explicit preconditioned iterative method based on generic approximate sparse pseudoinverse. Large scale evaluation experiments were conducted using two real-world traffic datasets, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed model can achieve better balance between forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency compared to benchmark models. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the complex temporal dependency and various external factors, it is challenging to capture its nonlinear and unsteady trends accurately. In addition, there are several inevitable errors in the traffic sensor record, including bias and noise. However, most recent works regard the record data as exact input ignoring the effect of unknown errors. In this research, a novel framework that integrates Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method and the Bidirectional Gate Recurrent Units (BiGRU) model was proposed to eliminate noise and enhance short-term prediction. The proposed model is mainly divided into three stages. Firstly, the EEMD algorithm adaptively decomposes the nonlinear and non-steady passenger flow signal into several sub-signals, which share more straightforward fluctuation trends and higher correlation coefficients in the preprocessing stage. Secondly, in the feature recognition and extraction stage, knowledge of the transportation field and statistical theories are applied to analyze and extract the critical decomposed components. Finally, in the prediction stage, the stacked BiGRU can learn and extract information from the input features in both directions and use a multi-step prediction to output the final prediction result. A real dataset of the Chengdu metro system is included in our experiments. The experimental results reveal that the proposed EEMD-BiGRU model's prediction performance exceeds all benchmark models. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the proposed model is reduced by up to 28.29% compared to a single GRU model without EEMD preprocessing. Also, experiments show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method for predicting short-term passenger flow in metro systems. © 2022

AB  - With well-defined graphs, graph convolution based spatiotemporal neural networks for traffic prediction have achieved great performance in numerous tasks. Compared to other methods, the networks can exploit the latent spatial dependencies between nodes according to the adjacency relationship. However, as the topological structure of the real road network tends to be intricate, it is difficult to accurately quantify the correlations between nodes in advance. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network based adaptive graph learning algorithm (AdapGL) to acquire the complex dependencies. First, by developing a novel graph learning module, more possible correlations between nodes can be adaptively captured during training. Second, inspired by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the parameters of the prediction network module and the graph learning module are optimized by alternate training. An elaborate loss function is leveraged for graph learning to ensure the sparsity of the generated affinity matrix. In this way, the expectation maximization of one part can be realized under the condition that the other part is the best estimate. Finally, the graph structure is updated by a weighted sum approach. The proposed algorithm can be applied to most graph convolution based networks for traffic forecast. Experimental results demonstrated that our method can not only further improve the accuracy of traffic prediction, but also effectively exploit the hidden correlations of the nodes.

AB  - Big data and cloud computing are becoming more critical in transportation systems as these technologies develop. Transportation companies can recognize and forecast potential traffic problems and offer appropriate responses. To avoid hindering mobility, one might use predictive analytics to assess the effect of various development initiatives and suggest a viable alternative. Due to automobiles’ flexibility and rapid changes in their environment, creating an effective communication system for vehicular networks is tough. An intelligent transportation system with big data analytics and cloud computing (STS-BCC) is the goal of this research work. Data mining is used to anticipate traffic conditions using a machine learning method. The cloud platform provides a secure storage service and processing unit to aid traffic forecasting. The experimental analysis finds the prediction accuracy of 97.45% and proves the efficient integration of big data analytics and cloud computing technologies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To achieve a secure interconnected Industrial Control System (ICS) architecture, security practitioners depend on accurate identification of network host behavior. However, accurate machine learning based host identification methods depends on the availability of significant quantities of network traffic data, which can be difficult to obtain due to system constraints such as network security, data confidentiality, and physical location. In this work, we propose a network traffic feature prediction method based on a generative model, which achieves high host identification accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a joint training algorithm to improve host identification performance compared to separate training of the generative model and the classifier responsible for host identification.

AB  - Network traffic forecasting provides key information for network management, resource allocation, traffic attack detection. However, traditional linear and non-linear network traffic forecasting models cannot achieve enough prediction accuracy for future traffic prediction. In order to resolve this problem, a network traffic prediction method based on SA (Simulated Annealing) optimized ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model)-BPNN (Back Propagation Neural Network) is proposed in this paper, which makes comprehensive use of linear model ARIMA, non-linear model BPNN and optimization algorithm SA. With enhancement of the BPNN global optimization ability, it can fully realize the potential of mining linear and non-linear laws of historical network traffic data, hence improving the prediction accuracy. This paper selects the historical network traffic data of two different sampling points in the WIDE project to predict, and utilizes the MAE(Mean Absolute Error), RMSE(Root Mean Square Error), and the MAPE(Mean Absolute Percentage Error) as the evaluation index of the prediction effect. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperformed traditional network traffic prediction model, with several improvements in network traffic prediction accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the applicability of measuring internet traffic as an input of short-term electricity demand forecasts. We believe our study makes a significant contribution to the literature, especially in short-term load prediction techniques, as we found that Internet traffic can be a useful variable in certain models and can increase prediction accuracy when compared to models in which it is not a variable. In addition, we found that the prediction error could be further reduced by applying a new multivariate model called VARX, which added exogenous variables to the univariate model called VAR. The VAR model showed excellent forecasting performance in the univariate model, rather than using the artificial neural network model, which had high prediction accuracy in the previous study. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - With the rapid development of mobile cellular technologies and the increasing popularity of mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, timely mobile traffic forecasting with high accuracy becomes more and more critical for proactive network service provisioning and efficient network resource allocation in smart cities. Traditional traffic forecasting methods mostly rely on time series prediction techniques, which fail to capture the complicated dynamic nature and spatial relations of mobile traffic demand. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, graph attention spatial-temporal network (GASTN), for accurate citywide mobile traffic forecasting, which can capture not only local geographical dependency but also distant inter-region relationship when considering spatial factor. Specifically, GASTN considers spatial correlation through our constructed spatial relation graph and utilizes structural recurrent neural networks to model the global near-far spatial relationships as well as the temporal dependencies. In the framework of GASTN, two attention mechanisms are designed to integrate different effects in a holistic way. Besides, in order to further enhance the prediction performance, we propose a collaborative global-local learning strategy for the training of GASTN, which takes full advantage of the knowledge from both the global model and local models for individual regions and enhance the effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world mobile traffic dataset demonstrate that our GASTN model dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. And it reveals that a significant enhancement in the prediction performance of GASTN can be obtained by leveraging the collaborative global-local learning strategy. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Road-network traffic monitoring on city-scale is critical for a wide range of applications, such as traffic forecasting, congestion identification, traffic safety, and urban planning, etc. Despite the fruitful research outcomes, however, most traffic monitoring models suffered from limited coverage, data sparsity, and data deviation, which leads to a biased and inaccurate result. With the widespread usage of mobile phones, mobile signaling data is of great value for various fields, especially for monitoring urban traffic. Thousands cell towers are distributed in the urban area, which can serve as ubiquitous sensors. Specifically, a mobile phone will passively generate a mobile signaling record that contains users’ spatiotemporal information. When mobile phone users move with their phones, their phones will interact with cell towers and these towers can obtain their mobile signaling records. And these signaling records contain sufficient information for traffic monitoring. However, there also exists excessive noise in signaling records, which makes most monitoring models abandon these data. In this paper, we present the Urban-STM scheme, which utilizes large-scale anonymous and coarse-grained mobile signaling data to infer road-network traffic conditions. We apply our scheme to a real-world signaling dataset in Changchun city and present an extensive validation study based on 2000 taxicabs’ GPS trajectories. Experiment results show that our scheme improves traffic monitoring performance in terms of coverage and accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the more and more in-depth research on intelligent transportation, many scholars have proposed their models for accurate prediction of traffic. In this paper, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the existing models and propose our own model. In our model, the temporal and spatial factors are taken into account. Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Gated Linear Units (GLU) are used to learn the short-term temporal features of traffic data, and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is used to learn the spatial features of traffic data. In order to fully learn short-term feature changes, a multi time step perception layer is proposed. A new network GCGRU is proposed to learn the long-term features of traffic data. As the sensor will be affected by urban canyon, weather, and other factors, there will be missing value and noise in the collected data. We created a short-term trend based missing value filling up algorithm to fill in missing values and use Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) algorithm to eliminate noise of training data set. In order to reduce the process of adjusting parameters manually in the model training process, we propose k-block search method based on fuzzy extreme points. Finally, the model is compared with the existing traffic forecasting models, and the analysis results show that our model has advantages in many indicators. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The automatic identification system (AIS) plays a vital role in maritime traffic surveillance. AIS is designed for remotely tracking vessels but nowadays also becomes a useful data source to enable vessels' trajectory prediction so as to facilitate early alert of potential collision risks. Recent studies focus on improving prediction accuracy through the machine learning and knowledge-based technologies but the computational cost also greatly increases due to the model complexity of these methodologies. It becomes a practical challenge to realize near real-time (NRT) trajectory prediction of a large volume of ships. For risk alert application, forecasting timeliness is one of the key design considerations. In this paper, we propose a concurrent processing cluster solution to empower advanced trajectory forecasting for hundreds of vessels in NRT. The proposed solution relies on the properly determined frameworks by customizing the desired features for an integrated solution. Meanwhile, a novel task-based load balancing strategy with newly defined metrics are proposed, which aims to reduce the makespan of jobs and outperforms the existing load balancing algorithms. A practicable cluster system has been successfully implemented, serving as a step toward unlocking the power of advanced maritime traffic forecasting technologies and enabling the benefit from the latest progress on the methodological innovation. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Increasing demands to access the internet through mobile infrastructures have in turn increased demands for improved quality and speed in communication services. One possible solution to meet these demands is to use cellular traffic forecasting to improve network performance. In this paper, a model for predicting traffic at a selected cellular base station (BS) is proposed. In the model, spatiotemporal features from neighboring stations to the target BS are used, and this information is used for forecasting through a series of surfaces evolving over time and a deep learning architecture consisting of 3D convolutional networks. Experimental results showed that this method outperformed other approaches used to predict traffic data. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a particularly challenging application of spatiotemporal forecasting, due to the time-varying traffic patterns and the complicated spatial dependencies on road networks. To address this challenge, we learn the traffic network as a graph and propose a novel deep learning framework, Traffic Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (TGC-LSTM), to learn the interactions between roadways in the traffic network and forecast the network-wide traffic state. We define the traffic graph convolution based on the physical network topology. The relationship between the proposed traffic graph convolution and the spectral graph convolution is also discussed. An L1-norm on graph convolution weights and an L2-norm on graph convolution features are added to the model's loss function to enhance the interpretability of the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods on two real-world traffic state datasets. The visualization of the graph convolution weights indicates that the proposed framework can recognize the most influential road segments in real-world traffic networks.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Air navigation service providers ensure that aircrafts keep safely apart by prescribing vertical and horizontal distances to each other. In the European Union and its associated members, regulation is carried out via a performance scheme which measures and sets targets for the different key performance areas. For the environmental area, targets in terms of CO2 and other pollutants were set by assuming that there would be continuous improvements for the Key performance Environment indicator based on actual trajectory. However, although a higher Horizontal Flight Efficiency (HFE) measurement usually means a more direct flight trajectory, this does not necessarily translate into a climate optimal trajectory. Thus, vertical flight efficiency also needs to be considered. There is also an interdependency between airspace and Air Traffic Management Capacity and Environment: when the offered capacity falls short of the demand for flights, ground delays, holdings and traffic shifts to adjacent areas occur. This entails detours and a deterioration of the HFE-indicator. Results show that total climate costs for 2018 and 2019 may be as high as 1 bn EUR, of which about 34% is due to CO2 emissions. In particular, the climate costs of CO2 emissions due to capacity constraints range from 54 to 301 million EUR, depending on whether CO2 costs are measured in terms of avoidance costs or under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Following the first criterion and the short to medium run up to 2030, the estimated costs would amount to 112 million EUR. In the long run, from 2040 to 2060, these costs would amount to 301 Million EUR. With the estimates of the EU ETS, the cost by 2030 would be close to 54 million EUR and 153.5 million EUR for the long run. Volatility of carbon pricing may play a very significant role, but fortunately can be hedged. Therefore, a shortfall of capacity leads to delay costs and considerable environmental costs. As capacity is planned in the medium to long-term, traffic forecasts are a crucial element. This means that further research is warranted into the interdependency of traffic forecasts, capacity and environmental costs. © 2021 Publicaciones Dyna Sl. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the public transportation domain, accurate estimation of travel times helps to manage rider expectations as well as to provide a powerful tool for transportation agencies to coordinate the public transport vehicles. Although many statistical and machine learning methods have been proposed to estimate travel times, none of the methods consider utilizing predicted traffic information. Forecasting how congestion is going to evolve is critical for accurate travel time estimations. In this paper, we present DeepTRANS, which incorporates traffic forecasting information to our prior Deep Learning-based Bus Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) model, increasing its accuracy by 21% in estimating bus travel time. © VLDB Endowment.

AB  - Transfer learning is a modern concept that focuses on the application of ideas, models, and algorithms, developed in one applied area, for solving a similar problem in another area. In this paper, we identify links between methodologies in two fields: video prediction and spatiotemporal traffic forecasting. The similarities of the video stream and citywide traffic data structures are discovered and analogues between historical development and modern states of the methodologies are presented and discussed. The idea of transferring video prediction models to the urban traffic forecasting domain is validated using a large real-world traffic data set. The list of transferred techniques includes spatial filtering by predefined kernels in combination with time series models and spectral graph convolutional artificial neural networks. The obtained models' forecasting performance is compared to the baseline traffic forecasting models: non-spatial time series models and spatially regularized vector autoregression models. We conclude that the application of video prediction models and algorithms for urban traffic forecasting is effective both in terms of observed forecasting accuracy and development, and training efforts. Finally, we discuss problems and obstacles of transferring methodologies and present potential directions for further research. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In recent decades, studies on short-term traffic speed forecasting of the large-scale road are a new challenge for researchers and engineers. Especially based on deep learning neural networks, studies on short-term traffic forecasting have achieved mush-room growth. This study proposes a stacked Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit neural network model to predict the traffic speed of the expressway over different estimation time intervals in an effective manner. By building a multiscale-grid model, it can take less time to derive a set of key traffic parameters of different scales to predict traffic speed of the various-scale road. The speed prediction of small-scale sections can cover more detailed road spatial features preparing for Vehicle Navigation System, and the speed prediction of large-scale sections can establish the real-time traffic control strategies. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we use the floating car data, with an updating frequency of 1 minute from the urban freeway of Beijing, for model training and testing. The experimental results show that the stacked BiGRU network with the multiscale-grid model enables to capture the spatial-temporal characteristics of traffic speed efficiently. Furthermore, the BiGRU with two layers (BiGRU-2L) outperforms benchmark models in the prediction of the traffic speed, which presents a significant advantage in reducing the overfitting problem, decreasing the excessive time-consuming and improving the effective use of limited computation resources.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Urban traffic congestion has an obvious spatial and temporal relationship and is relevant to real traffic conditions. Traffic speed is a significant parameter for reflecting congestion of road networks, which is feasible to predict. Traditional traffic forecasting methods have poor accuracy for complex urban road networks, and do not take into account weather and other multisource data. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based bidirectional spatial–temporal network (CNN-BDSTN) using traffic speed and weather data by crawling electric map information. In CNN-BDSTN, the spatial dependence of traffic network is captured by CNN to compose the time-series input dataset. Bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) is introduced to train the convolutional time-series dataset. Compared with linear regression, autoregressive integrated moving average, extreme gradient boosting, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM, CNN-BDSTN presents its ability of spatial and temporal extension and achieves more accurately predicted results. In this case study, traffic speed data of 155 roads and weather information in Urumqi, Xinjiang, People’s Republic of China, with 1-min interval for 5 months are tested by CNN-BDSTN. The experiment results show that the accuracy of CNN-BDSTN with input of weather information is better than the scenario of no weather information, and the average predicted error is less than 5%. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.

AB  - Purpose: Deregulation of domestic markets and the liberalization of international markets have dramatically changed air transportation. One of the important results of this change is the environmental effects of air transportation. This study aims to examine the implications of air transportation on environmental sustainability in the context of airline business strategies in liberalized and globalized air transport industry. Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses the relationship between liberalization, airline strategies and environmental sustainability of air transportation using the related literature. Then, to show some environmental impacts on the axis of the relationship discussed, emission rates for the aircraft landing and take-off phase were calculated on a global basis based on the aircraft traffic. Findings: The discussion in the paper shows that the liberalization policies and the strategies of airlines supported by these policies, in essence, contradict the environmental sustainability of air transport. Considering the flight share projections of EUROCONTROL for different aircraft types on a global basis and the World Bank’s global flight traffic forecast for the years 2016 and 2025, it has been demonstrated that the number of aircraft departures will increase by 30%, whilst the number of aircraft emissions will increase by 41.5%. Practical implications: Airlines are one of the main actors that will play a role in reducing the environmental impacts of air transportation. Therefore, this study is important in giving an idea to both policymakers and airline managers on how airline companies’ strategies should be shaped to realize both corporate sustainability and environmentally sustainable air transportation. Originality/value: There are many studies in the literature regarding the environmental effects of air transport. However, there are not many studies linking environmental impacts with airline strategies that directly affect air transport demand. This study is different in that it gives environmental sustainability by associating it with its root causes. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper capitalizes on the increasingly high relevance gained by data-intensive technologies in the development of intelligent transportation system, which calls for the progressive adoption of adaptive, self-learning methods for solving modeling, simulation, and optimization problems. In this regard, certain mechanisms and processes observed in nature, including the animal brain, have proved themselves to excel not only in terms of efficiently capturing time-evolving stimuli, but also at undertaking complex tasks by virtue of mechanisms that can be extrapolated to computer algorithms and methods. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-The-Art around the application of bioinspired methods to the challenges arising in the broad field of intelligent transportation system (ITS). This systematic survey is complemented by an initiatory taxonomic introduction to bioinspired computational intelligence, along with the basics of its constituent techniques. A focus is placed on which research niches are still unexplored by the community in different ITS subareas. The open issues and research directions for the practical implementation of ITS endowed with bioinspired computational intelligence are also discussed in detail. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - The approach taken by the second place winner of the TRANSFOR prediction challenge is presented. The challenge involves forecasting travel speeds on two arterial links in Xi'an City in China for two five hour periods on a single day. Travel speeds are measured from trajectory information on probe vehicles from a fleet of vehicles for a large sub-area of the city. After experimenting with several deep learning methods, we settle on a simple non-parametric kernel regression approach. The method, borrowed from previous work in fixed route transit predictions, formalizes the intuition that in urban systems most failure patterns are recurrent. Our choice is supported by test results where the method outperformed all evaluated neural architectures. The results suggest simple methods are very competitive, particularly considering the high lifecycle cost of deep learning models. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forecasting future traffic flows from previous ones is a challenging problem because of their complex and dynamic nature of spatio-temporal structures. Most existing graph-based CNNs attempt to capture the static relations while largely neglecting the dynamics underlying sequential data. In this article, we present dynamic spatio-temporal graph-based CNNs (DST-GCNNs) by learning expressive features to represent spatio-temporal structures and predict future traffic flows from surveillance video data. In particular, DST-GCNN is a two stream network. In the flow prediction stream, we present a novel graph-based spatio-temporal convolutional layer to extract features from a graph representation of traffic flows. Then several such layers are stacked together to predict future flows over time. Meanwhile, the relations between traffic flows in the graph are often time variant as the traffic condition changes over time. To capture the graph dynamics, we use the graph prediction stream to predict the dynamic graph structures, and the predicted structures are fed into the flow prediction stream. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performances compared with the other state-of-the-art methods. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

AB  - To make the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) more efficient and robust, researchers are working hard. Analysis of traffic data helps ITS to be more helpful. Mobile phones are the prime source of traffic data. The vast availability of data and increased processing speed of mobile phones is making ITS more robust. Presently for traffic prediction, the entire mobile user’s data is accumulated at the central server. The information is then aggregated together to make predictions. In this approach, sensitive user data have the risk of privacy and security—massive user data uploading on the server results in latency.This paper proposes a decentralized approach for vehicular traffic prediction that allows ‘selected’ local mobiles/ organizations (clients) to train the model and share the trained model securely to the server. The selection of organizations to participate in the training process is made by clustering algorithms. The server then aggregates the locally trained model and shares the aggregated model to all the clients again © 2021 School of Science, IHU. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluating web traffic on a web server is highly critical for web service providers since, without a proper demand forecast, customers could have lengthy waiting times and abandon that website. However, this is a challenging task since it requires making reliable predictions based on the arbitrary nature of human behavior. We introduce an architecture that collects source data and in a supervised way performs the forecasting of the time series of the page views. Based on the Wikipedia page views dataset proposed in a competition by Kaggle in 2017, we created an updated version of it for the years 2018–2020. This dataset is processed and the features and hidden patterns in data are obtained for later designing an advanced version of a recurrent neural network called Long Short-Term Memory. This AI model is distributed training, according to the paradigm called data parallelism and using the Downpour training strategy. Predictions made for the seven dominant languages in the dataset are accurate with loss function and measurement error in reasonable ranges. Despite the fact that the analyzed time series have fairly bad patterns of seasonality and trend, the predictions have been quite good, evidencing that an analysis of the hidden patterns and the features extraction before the design of the AI model enhances the model accuracy. In addition, the improvement of the accuracy of the model with the distributed training is remarkable. Since the task of predicting web traffic in as precise quantities as possible requires large datasets, we designed a forecasting system to be accurate despite having limited data in the dataset. We tested the proposed model on the new Wikipedia page views dataset we created and obtained a highly accurate prediction; actually, the mean absolute error of predictions regarding the original one on average is below 30. This represents a significant step forward in the field of time series prediction for web traffic forecasting. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - During the past 50 years telecommunication network technology has raced ahead powered by exponential advances in computer chip and fiber optic technology. The introduction of packet-switched networks and the Internet has increased network traffic demands exponentially and has nurtured a variety of new telecommunication services (e.g., email, web-surfing, social media, streaming services, e-commerce, the Internet of Things, etc.) over the past 30 years. This rapidly changing environment (along with certain technical considerations) has made it very difficult to give accurate forecasts of traffic demands for both the short-term (intraday) and for the longer term (year-to-year). Telecommunications network design has evolved from the voice-only networks of the 1970s where operations research (OR) methodology was indispensable to current multiservice packet-switched data networks whose uncertainty and rapid evolution has reduced the utility of classical optimization models that rely on accurate traffic demand forecasts. After summarizing the major developments in telecommunications network design technologies/services, we describe some promising future research directions to address an environment where technology is ever-changing and traffic forecasting is difficult. In particular, we focus on the public Internet and emphasize possible work where OR/optimization methodology may be useful in understanding and solving telecommunications network routing and design problems. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Automatic vehicle identification (AVI) data, Integrated Circuit (IC) card data and Global Positioning System (GPS) data offer an emerging and promising source of information for analysis of traffic problems. Research on insights and information from AVI data for transport analysis has made little progress in developing specific applications especially. The emergence of multi-source data provides us with a new perspective for multi-mode transportation. This paper proposes a multi-mode traffic demand forecasting method based on AVI data, metro IC card data, and taxi GPS data. The paper extracts traffic origins and destinations (OD) information of travelers from the multi-source data and uses the extracted data for traffic zone division. Finally, a multi-mode traffic forecasting model is established on this basis. GPS data of taxi trips are selected as the clustering data and k-means algorithm was adopted to divide traffic zones in Shenzhen. Moreover, the research applies the principle of convex hull to outline the boundary of the cell. Additionally, this paper establishes the multi-mode transportation forecasting model by integrating the correlation between various transportation modes into the deep learning model for prediction. The results show that the multi-mode demand forecasting model has higher accuracy and better forecasting results comparing it with the single-mode demand forecasting model which is referring to the conventional four-step procedure. The result demonstrates that effective traffic and travel data can be obtained from multi-source data, providing an opportunity to improve the analysis of complex travel patterns and behaviors for travel demand modeling and transportation planning. Furthermore, the substantive contribution of this research is that it provides strong empirical evidence for the existence of correlation among multi-mode travels and travel demand. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Applications of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) make the life of human beings more intelligent and convenient. However, in the present, there are some problems in IoV, such as data silos and poor privacy preservation. To address the challenges in IoV, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning pool (BFLP) framework. BFLP allows the models to be trained without sharing raw data, and it can choose the most suitable federated learning method according to actual application scenarios. Considering the poor computing power of vehicle systems, we construct a lightweight encryption algorithm called CPC to protect privacy. To verify the proposed framework, we conducted experiments in obstacle-avoiding and traffic forecast scenarios. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively protect the user's privacy, and it is more stable and efficient compared with traditional machine learning technique. Also, we compare the CPC algorithm with other encryption algorithms. And the results show that its calculation cost is much lower compared to other symmetric encryption algorithms.  © 2021 Yongqiang Peng et al.

AB  - The air transport crisis, caused by the Covid Pandemic, not only forced the limiting of air traffic operations, but also, the verification existing air traffic forecasts. This time can be used for an in-depth look at the existing procedures at the airport, namely the procedures for performing aircraft take-off operations. After the renewed increase in air traffic, the problem of proper positioning of aircraft for take-off will reappear. The capacity problem at airports will return as air traffic increases. Capacity is a parameter that determines the traffic capacity of an airport, expressed as the theoretical maximum number of air operations that the airport is able to handle per unit of time. This parameter may also result from the seasonality of air traffic both throughout the year and changes over single days or even hours. Achieving a certain capacity may require the expansion of airport infrastructure or more efficient management of airport operations. An undesirable effect of increasing air traffic are delays related to airport capacity. The existing queue of aircraft waiting for take-off operations at the runway threshold, could be due to poor management and queuing of aircraft or insufficient airport infrastructure. It is possible to eliminate the queue phenomenon, at the runway threshold, through better sequencing of aircraft push-outs. This makes it possible to determine the order of the take-off of aircraft, already at the stage of push-out. The aim of the article is to present the possibility of a more effective use of the aircraft pushback sequence, increasing the capacity of the airport maneuvering area. The proposed algorithm sequencing of aircraft to taxi in order to minimize delays associated with deviations from the flight plan, the taxiway of the stand to the runway threshold, thereby reducing emissions into the atmosphere. The algorithm is based on the A-CDM project, which unites airports to exchange information necessary to better use the capacity of these airports. © 2021, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

AB  - This study proposes a novel multi-module deep neural network framework which aims at improving intelligent long-term traffic forecasting. Following our previous system, the internal architecture of the new system adds deep learning modules that enable data separation during computation. Thus, prediction becomes more accurate in many sections of the road network and gives dependable results even under possible changes inweather conditions during driving. The performance of the framework is then evaluated for diffierent cases, which include all plausible cases of driving, i.e., regular days, holidays, and days involving severe weather conditions. Compared with other traffic predicting systems that employ the convolutional neural networks, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and the time series model, it is concluded that the system proposed herein achieves better performance and helps drivers schedule their trips well in advance. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The short-term forecast can be used to respond to the unexpected business shocks in advance, thus guaranteeing user experience. We present a practical communication traffic forecasting technology based on autoregressive moving average model. The proposed short-term prediction method is mainly based on the product seasonal model. The orders of product seasonal ARMA equation are recognized by the Akaike information criterion, and the parameters of equation are estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The unit root test is used to judge the stability and reversibility of the model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated. The experimental result shows that the method has high prediction accuracy. The short-term forecast can provide a basis for mobile operators to accurately expand capacity. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Network-wide traffic forecasting is a critical component of modern intelligent transportation systems for urban traffic management and control. With the rise of artificial intelligence, many recent studies attempted to use deep neural networks to extract comprehensive features from traffic networks to enhance prediction performance, given the volume and variety of traffic data has been greatly increased. Considering that traffic status on a road segment is highly influenced by the upstream/downstream segments and nearby bottlenecks in the traffic network, extracting well-localized features from these neighboring segments is essential for a traffic prediction model. Although the convolution neural network or graph convolution neural network has been adopted to learn localized features from the complex geometric or topological structure of traffic networks, the lack of flexibility in the local-feature extraction process is still a big issue. Classical wavelet transform can detect sudden changes and peaks in temporal signals. Analogously, when extending to the graph/spectral domain, graph wavelet can concentrate more on key vertices in the graph and discriminatively extract localized features. In this study, to capture the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in network-wide traffic data, we learn the traffic network as a graph and propose a graph wavelet gated recurrent (GWGR) neural network. The graph wavelet is incorporated as a key component for extracting spatial features in the proposed model. A gated recurrent structure is employed to learn temporal dependencies in the sequence data. Comparing to baseline models, the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance and training efficiency on two real-world datasets. In addition, experiments show that the sparsity of graph wavelet weight matrices greatly increases the interpretability of GWGR. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A spatiotemporal approach that simultaneously utilises both spatial and temporal relationships is gaining scientific interest in the field of traffic flow forecasting. Accurate identification of the spatiotemporal structure (dependencies amongst traffic flows in space and time) plays a critical role in modern traffic forecasting methodologies, and recent developments of data-driven feature selection and extraction methods allow the identification of complex relationships. This paper systematically reviews studies that apply feature selection and extraction methods for spatiotemporal traffic forecasting. The reviewed bibliographic database includes 211 publications and covers the period from early 1984 to March 2018. A synthesis of bibliographic sources clarifies the advantages and disadvantages of different feature selection and extraction methods for learning the spatiotemporal structure and discovers trends in their applications. We conclude that there is a clear need for development of comprehensive guidelines for selecting appropriate spatiotemporal feature selection and extraction methods for urban traffic forecasting. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Short-term traffic forecasting on large street networks is significant in transportation and urban management, such as real-time route guidance and congestion alleviation. Nevertheless, it is very challenging to obtain high prediction accuracy with reasonable computational cost due to the complex spatial dependency on the traffic network and the time-varying traffic patterns. To address these issues, this paper develops a residual graph convolution long short-term memory (RGC-LSTM) model for spatial-temporal data forecasting considering the network topology. This model integrates a new graph convolution operator for spatial modelling on networks and a residual LSTM structure for temporal modelling considering multiple periodicities. The proposed model has few parameters, low computational complexity, and a fast convergence rate. The framework is evaluated on both the 10-min traffic speed data from Shanghai, China and the 5-min Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) traffic flow data. Experiments show the advantages of the proposed approach over various state-of-the-art baselines, as well as consistent performance across different datasets. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The proliferation of mobile devices over recent years has led to a dramatic increase in mobile traffic. Demand for enabling accurate mobile app identification is coming as it is an essential step to improve a multitude of network services: accounting, security monitoring, traffic forecasting, and quality-of-service. However, traditional traffic classification techniques do not work well for mobile traffic. Besides, multiple machine learning solutions developed in this field are severely restricted by their handcrafted features as well as unreliable datasets. In this paper, we propose a framework for real network traffic collection and labeling in a scalable way. A dedicated Android traffic capture tool is developed to build datasets with perfect ground truth. Using our established dataset, we make an empirical exploration on deep learning methods for the task of mobile app identification, which can automate the feature engineering process in an end-to-end fashion. We introduce three of the most representative deep learning models and design and evaluate our dedicated classifiers, namely, a SDAE, a 1D CNN, and a bidirectional LSTM network, respectively. In comparison with two other baseline solutions, our CNN and RNN models with raw traffic inputs are capable of achieving state-of-the-art results regardless of TLS encryption. Specifically, the 1D CNN classifier obtains the best performance with an accuracy of 91.8% and macroaverage F-measure of 90.1%. To further understand the trained model, sample-specific interpretations are performed, showing how it can automatically learn important and advanced features from the uppermost bytes of an app's raw flows. © 2020 Xin Wang et al.

AB  - Despite the growing importance of mobile tracking technology in urban planning and traffic forecasting, its utilization in the understanding of the basic laws governing tourist flows remains limited. Knowledge regarding the motivations and spatial behavior of tourists has great potential in sustainable tourism studies. In this paper, we combine social media (Twitter) and mobile positioning data (MPD) in the analysis of international tourism flows in Szeged, a secondary urban center in Hungary. First, the content of geotagged and non-geotagged Twitter messages referring to Szeged in a six-month period of 2018 was analyzed. In this way specific events attracting foreign tourists were identified. Then, using MPD data of foreign SIM cards, visitor peaks in the investigated period were defined. With the joint application of the social media and mobile positioning analytical tools, we were able to identify those attractions (festivals, sport and cultural events, etc.) that generated significant tourism arrivals in the city. Furthermore, using the mixed-method approach we were also able to analyze the movements of foreign visitors during one large-scale tourism event and evaluate its hinterland. Overall, this study supports the idea that social media data should be combined with other real-time data sources, such as MPD, in order to gain a more precise understanding of the behavior of tourists. The proposed analytical tool can contribute to methodological and conceptual development in the field, and information gained by its application can positively influence not only tourism management and planning but also tourism marketing and placemaking. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate and timely traffic forecasting is significant for intelligent transportation management. However, existing approaches model the temporal and spatial features of traffic flow inadequately. To address these limitations, a novel deep learning traffic forecasting framework based on graph attention network (GAT) and temporal convolutional network (TCN) is presented in this paper, termed as graph attention temporal convolutional networks (GATCN). More specifically, GATCN deal with the spatial features by GAT, and the temporal features by TCN. The layer fused by GAT and TCN enables the proposed model to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics that lie in traffic flow, while considering exogenous factors. In addition, nodes in the graph can capture the information of their neighborhoods by stacking multiple layers. Precision and robustness of the proposed method have been evaluated through testing on the real-world dataset. Results show that the proposed model outperforms other baselines. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the preconditions for good quality management of seaports is forecasting the traffic according to the number of passengers and the number of vehicles; in this way it is possible to plan and prepare activities for the smooth operation of the ports. This paper researches the port system as part of the coastal liner maritime transport. The set hypothesis is that the model of forecasting the traffic could be presented as a function of two variables. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is used to select the forecasting parameters. Based on the choice of parameters, using the Least Squares Method (LSM), the trend analysis is performed to choose the forecasting functions for maritime liner transport on the example of the Split City port. The statistical analysis on the choosed forecasting model using the coefficient of determination r2 and adjusted r2 model is performed to confirm the choice. © Faculty of Maritime Studies Rijeka, 2020.

AB  - Understanding individual and crowd dynamics in urban environments is critical for numerous applications, such as urban planning, traffic forecasting, and location-based services. However, researchers have developed travel demand models to accomplish this task with survey data that are expensive and acquired at low frequencies. In contrast, emerging data collection methods have enabled researchers to leverage machine learning techniques with a tremendous amount of mobility data for analyzing and forecasting people's behaviors. In this study, we developed a reinforcement learning-based approach for modeling and simulation of people mass movement using the global positioning system (GPS) data. Unlike traditional travel demand modeling approaches, our method focuses on the problem of inferring the spatio-temporal preferences of individuals from the observed trajectories, and is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques. We applied the model to the data collected from a smartphone application and attempted to replicate a large amount of the population's daily movement by incorporating with agent-based multi-modal traffic simulation technologies. The simulation results indicate that agents can successfully learn and generate human-like travel activities. Furthermore, the proposed model performance significantly outperforms the existing methods in synthetic urban dynamics. © 2020

AB  - Traffic congestion prediction in citywide road networks is a challenging research field in metropolitan transportation operation and management. Recent advances in GPS technology offer great opportunities to improve upon the limitations on the availability and quality of traffic data. Motivated by the success of deep neural networks and considering the spatial dependencies and temporal evolutions of network traffic, we propose an innovative deep learning-based mapping to cube architecture for network-wide urban traffic forecasting. Experiments using real Taxi GPS vehicle trajectory data confirm the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach combining 3-Dimensional Convolutional Networks (C3D) with Convolutional Neuron Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neuron Networks (RNNs), called CRC3D as a hybrid method integrating CNN-RNNs and C3Ds. We also compared a variety of recurrent neural network architectures. Results show that CRC3D succeeds in inheriting the advantages of C3D and CNN-RNN, and show its consistent and satisfactory results in urban complex system. © 2020 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

AB  - The inaccuracy of traffic forecasts has long stood as a central research theme in the field of infrastructure and transportation studies. The literature presents several motives for this phenomenon, ranging from a political bias, insufficient technical preparation, changing urban patterns, and economic dynamics. Uncertainty due to the inaccuracy of forecasts can have a profound impact on the infrastructure development process, right through from the preliminary studies up until the operation and re-negotiation of contracts (in cases when projects are developed using a concessions model). This paper provides an extensive systematic review of forecast inaccuracy in roads and railways projects (analyzing trends, causes, and results). The research found that: (1) forecasts in rail projects are generally more optimistic than in road projects; (2) over the last couple of decades the accuracy of forecasts has not improved significantly, and; (3) there has been a generalized ramp-up effect in forecasts. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a classical task for traffic management and it plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. However, since traffic data are mostly collected by traffic sensors or probe vehicles, sensor failures and the lack of probe vehicles will inevitably result in missing values in the collected raw data for some specific links in the traffic network. Although missing values can be imputed, existing data imputation methods normally need long-term historical traffic state data. As for short-term traffic forecasting, especially under edge computing and online prediction scenarios, traffic forecasting models with the capability of handling missing values are needed. In this study, we consider the traffic network as a graph and define the transition between network-wide traffic states at consecutive time steps as a graph Markov process. In this way, missing traffic states can be inferred step by step and the spatial–temporal relationships among the roadway links can be incorporated. Based on the graph Markov process, we propose a new neural network architecture for spatial–temporal data forecasting, i.e. the graph Markov network (GMN). By incorporating the spectral graph convolution operation, we also propose a spectral graph Markov network (SGMN). The proposed models are compared with baseline models and tested on three real-world traffic state datasets with various missing rates. Experimental results show that the proposed GMN and SGMN can achieve superior prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Besides, the proposed models’ parameters, weights, and predicted results are comprehensively analyzed and visualized. © 2020

AB  - This paper highlights a variety of uses for Big Data when developing project forecasts and model validations. In most travel models, validation often refers to estimating model volumes close to the observed highway counts. While this is an established practice for producing reasonable confidence in the model, these statistics are often not sufficient to build confidence in the project forecast. This is especially true for investment-grade level traffic and revenue forecasts for projects involving congestion pricing. This paper explores the application of Big Data to validate subarea models in multiple dimensions: subarea district-to-district origin-destination (O-D) flows; corridor segment-to-segment O-D flows; and trip length distribution by O-D types for the I-4 Ultimate Express Lanes Study. Additionally, the paper reviews historical O-D flows to determine the peak seasonal flow and appropriate O-D data to use in model validation and seed tables for Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation (ODME). In addition to model validation, the expanded Big Data O-D trips were assigned to multiple paths for each O-D pair built via Google Directions API to study the eligible corridor trips and the alternative corridors competing with the project. Furthermore, spatiotemporal distributions from Big Data were used to develop time-dependent trip tables for the Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) model.

AB  - The accurate estimation of future network traffic is a key enabler for early warning of network degradation and automated orchestration of network resources. The long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) is a popular architecture for network traffic forecasting, and has been successfully used in many applications. However, it has been observed that LSTMs suffer from limited memory capacity problems when the sequence is long. In this paper, we propose a gated dilated causal convolution based encoder-decoder (GDCC-ED) model for network traffic forecasting. The GDCC-ED learns a vector representation in the encoder from historical network traffic series, in which gated dilated causal convolutions are adopted to expand the long-range memory capacity. Moreover, different types of features in various perspectives, including temporal-independent and temporal-related features, are incorporated. In the decoder, the GDCC-ED exploits an RNN with LSTM units to map the vector representation back to a variable-length target sequence. Besides, a sequence data augmentation technique is designed to solve the problem of data scarcity. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art algorithms by 11.6%. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - An IoT is the communication of sensing devices linked to the Internet in order to communicate data. IoT devices have extremely critical reliability with an efficient and robust network condition. Based on enormous growth in devices and their connectivity, IoT contributes to the bulk of Internet traffic. Prediction of network traffic is very important function of any network. Traffic prediction is important to ensure good system efficiency and ensure service quality of IoT applications, as it relies primarily on congestion management, admission control, allocation of bandwidth to the system, and the identification of anomalies. In this paper, a complete overview of IoT traffic forecasting model using classic time series and artificial neural network is presented. For prediction of IoT traffic, real network traces are used. Prediction models are evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared values. The experimental results indicate that LSTM- and FNN-based predictive models are highly sensitive and can therefore be used to provide better performance as a timing sequence forecast model than the conventional traffic prediction techniques. © 2021 Shilpa P.

AB  - Traffic forecast in intelligent transportation system (ITS) involves the responsibility of traffic conductor, traffic control and so on, which is an important part in our daily life. Nowadays, traffic forecast schemes in ITS have been widely studied by researchers in many countries. However, these traffic forecast schemes do not take users’ privacy into consideration. Users’ privacy information is always leaked to the infrastructures and other users in the same system, and this can cause great damage to the information owner. In this paper, a privacy-preserving traffic forecast scheme is proposed, for ITS, to solve the problem of traffic forecast and privacy leakage together. The proposed scheme is based on a recurrent neural network which is operated by the infrastructures. In addition, the infrastructures or other vehicles can get nothing about the sender’s privacy from the data package sent by a target vehicle. Our simulation can prove the advantages of our scheme in terms of the forecast accuracy. The security analysis can prove the privacy-preserving property. At the end of simulation part, we give a detailed analysis of forecast accuracy and the fault tolerance of our traffic forecast scheme. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Traffic volume forecasts are fundamental to policymaking; yet, the impacts of forecast errors are rarely considered. Accordingly, traffic forecasts in 39 studies were compared to observed volumes after the forecast year had elapsed, yielding a mean error of 40%. To evaluate the effect of forecast accuracy, five case studies examined how forecast error affected investment decisions. Because errors of 11%, 12%, 20%, 33%, and 34% can alter investment decisions, the respective observed errors of 20%, 38%, 64%, 6%, and 52% meant the forecast error was potentially large enough to alter the investment decision based on each study's stated criterion. Although striving for more accurate forecasts is laudable, the results from the 39 studies showed that only a quarter of the variation in study accuracy is not attributable to random variation. Accordingly, until highly accurate forecasts become the norm, an interim recommendation for planners is to use empirical decision intervals, as shown herein, indicating the magnitude of error can alter investment decisions. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Short-term origin–destination (OD) flow prediction in urban rail transit (URT) plays a crucial role in smart and real-time URT operation and management. Different from other short-term traffic forecasting methods, the short-term OD flow prediction possesses three unique characteristics: (1) data availability: real-time OD flow is not available during the prediction; (2) data dimensionality: the dimension of the OD flow is much higher than the cardinality of transportation networks; (3) data sparsity: URT OD flow is spatiotemporally sparse. There is a great need to develop novel OD flow forecasting method that explicitly considers the unique characteristics of the URT system. To this end, a channel-wise attentive split–convolutional neural network (CAS-CNN) is proposed. The proposed model consists of many novel components such as the channel-wise attention mechanism and split CNN. In particular, an inflow/outflow-gated mechanism is innovatively introduced to address the data availability issue. We further originally propose a masked loss function to solve the data dimensionality and data sparsity issues. The model interpretability is also discussed in detail. The CAS–CNN model is tested on two large-scale real-world datasets from Beijing Subway, and it outperforms the rest of benchmarking methods. The proposed model contributes to the development of short-term OD flow prediction, and it also lays the foundations of real-time URT operation and management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Deep learning-based techniques are the state of the art in road traffic prediction or forecasting. Several deep neural networks have been proposed to predict the traffic but they have not been evaluated under common datasets. Current studies analyze their capacity to predict road traffic in general but do not focus on their capacity to predict the formation of congestions. This is critical for avoiding congestions or mitigate their negative impact. This paper progresses the current state of the art by presenting a comprehensive comparison of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks for road traffic prediction. The comparison is conducted using the same real traffic datasets, and under normal and congested traffic conditions. The evaluation includes new deep neural networks and error recurrent models. Our study first demonstrates that accurately predicting the traffic overall does not imply that a deep neural network can accurately predict the traffic when congestions are being formed. This reinforces the idea that prediction techniques must also be evaluated under congestion conditions. Our analysis also shows that exploiting the spatiotemporal evolution of the traffic (and not just the temporal one) provides better prediction accuracy overall and in particular under congestion conditions. The study also demonstrates that error recurrent models outperform deep neural networks that do not utilize an error feedback both under normal and congested traffic conditions. In particular, our study shows that the error recurrent model eRCNN is the deep learning technique that achieves to date the best traffic prediction accuracy. It is also important emphasizing that error recurrent models achieve better prediction accuracy with shallower neural networks and therefore lower computational cost. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate prediction of network-level traffic parameters during inclement weather conditions can greatly help in many transportation applications. Rainfall tends to have a quantifiable impact on driving behavior and traffic network performance. This impact is often studied for low-resolution rainfall data on small road networks, whereas this study investigates it in the context of a large traffic network and high-resolution rainfall radar images. First, the impact of rainfall intensity on traffic performance throughout the day and for different road categories is analyzed. Next, it is investigated whether including rainfall information can improve the predictive accuracy of the state-of-the-art traffic forecasting methods. Numerical results show that the impact of rainfall on traffic varies for different rainfall intensities as well as for different times of the day and days of the week. The results also show that incorporating rainfall data into prediction models improves their overall performance. The average reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for models with rainfall data is 4.5%. Experiments with downsampled rainfall data were also performed, and it was concluded that incorporating higher resolution weather data does indeed lead to an increase in performance of traffic prediction models. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.

AB  - Efficient risk allocation has been proven to be at the heart of effective and efficient infrastructure project operation. While most risks may be reasonably assigned in transport infrastructure projects, demand risk remains ambiguous due to the multiple factors influencing its appropriate allocation. The present research is a first attempt to introduce indicators as tools to guide contracting parties in assigning demand risk. The level of control, based on infrastructure characteristics and attributes, describes the potential control over demand an operator may have. The optimal demand risk allocation is seen as an assessment of the appropriateness of demand risk allocation effected. The indicators are constructed following accomplished rules set by supranational organizations. Furthermore, 51 project cases ranging different transport infrastructure modes from 19 European countries including projects delivered traditionally and as Public Private Partnerships were used to validate the indicators and assess their performance. Results show the potential of both indicators to guide governments, operators and also financiers in appropriately allocating demand risk in transport infrastructure projects. This optimality was shown to be related to more accurate traffic forecasts resulting in sustainable transport infrastructure as the project then delivers on its economic, environmental, and social/welfare targets. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - We propose a novel approach for network-wide traffic state prediction where the statistical time series model ARIMA is used to postprocess the residuals out of the fundamental machine learning algorithm MLP. This approach is named as NN-ARIMA. Neural Network MLP is employed to capture network-scale co-movement pattern of all traffic flows, and ARIMA is used to further extract location-specific traffic features in the residual time series out of Neural Network. The experiment results show that the postprocessing the residuals of Neural Network by the ARIMA analysis helps to significantly improve accuracy of traffic state prediction by 8.9–13.4% in term of mean squared error reduction. In order to verify the efficiency of the ARIMA analysis in the postprocessing, Multidimensional Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model is also employed to replace the role of Neural Network in the comparative experiment. Two streams of comparisons, (1) NN vs. NN-ARIMA and (2) MSVR vs. MSVR-ARIMA, are performed and show consistent results. The proposed approach not only can capture network-wide co-movement pattern of traffic flows, but also seize location-specific traffic characteristics as well as sharp nonlinearity of macroscopic traffic variables. The case study indicates that the accuracy of prediction can be significantly improved when both network-scale traffic features and location-specific characteristics are taken into account. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We present a novel approach for traffic forecasting in urban traffic scenarios using a combination of spectral graph analysis and deep learning. We predict both the low-level information (future trajectories) as well as the high-level information (road-agent behavior) from the extracted trajectory of each road-agent. Our formulation represents the proximity between the road agents using a weighted dynamic geometric graph (DGG). We use a two-stream graph-LSTM network to perform traffic forecasting using these weighted DGGs. The first stream predicts the spatial coordinates of road-agents, while the second stream predicts whether a road-agent is going to exhibit overspeeding, underspeeding, or neutral behavior by modeling spatial interactions between road-agents. Additionally, we propose a new regularization algorithm based on spectral clustering to reduce the error margin in long-term prediction (3-5 seconds) and improve the accuracy of the predicted trajectories. Moreover, we prove a theoretical upper bound on the regularized prediction error. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse, Lyft, Apolloscape, and NGSIM datasets and highlight the benefits over prior trajectory prediction methods. In practice, our approach reduces the average prediction error by approximately 75% over prior algorithms and achieves a weighted average accuracy of 91.2% for behavior prediction. Additionally, our spectral regularization improves long-term prediction by up to \text{70}\%. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic forecasting in urban area has attracted substantial attention in recent years due to its significant assitance for traffic dispatching and trip planning. However, this task is very challenging due to the complex dependencies inherent in the traffic process. In our study, recent and periodic dependencies are identified and used to describe the corresponding near-term and long-term effects of historical traffic data on future traffic states. Subsequently, during the recent dependency modeling, each road is found to correlate with its adjacent roads through traffic flow diffusion, then the correlation intensities are quantified and used to choose strongly correlated roads to build a critical road sequence. While for the periodic dependency modeling, since the historical speed series of a road segment exhibits multi-frequency attributes (i.e., low-frequency daily period and high-frequency stochastic fluctuation), wavelet transform is conducted to decompose the original speed series into low and high-frequency sub-series. On these bases, we propose a hybrid traffic speed forecasting model, flow and wavelet-integrated spatiooral network (FW-STN). In the FW-STN, the recent features are captured by the convolutional neural network (CNN) with near-term traffic data from the derived critical road sequence, and the periodic features are captured by the long short-term memory (LSTM) with the low and high-frequency sub-series. Both the recent and periodic features are then fused to conduct the final prediction. Experimental results on real traffic data show that the proposed approach outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods (with improvements of 3% 15% in mean average percentage error). © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Escalating traffic congestion in large and rapidly evolving metropolitan areas all around the world is one of the inescapable problems in our daily lives. In light of this situation, traffic monitoring and analytics is becoming the need of the hour in today's world. Real-time traffic analysis requires processing of data streams that are being generated continuously in real time to gain quick insights. The challenge of analyzing streaming data for real-time prediction can be overcome by exploiting deep learning techniques. Taking this as a motivation, this work aims to integrate big data technologies and deep learning techniques to develop a real-time data stream processing model for vehicle traffic forecast using ensemble learning approach. Real-time traffic data from an API is streamed using a distributed streaming platform called Kafka into Apache Spark where it is processed, and the traffic flow is predicted by a neural network ensemble model. This will reduce the travel time, cost, and energy through efficient decision making, thus having a positive impact on the environment. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.

AB  - In cellular networks, a deep knowledge of the traffic demand pattern in each cell is essential in network planning and optimization tasks. However, a precise forecast of the traffic time series per cell is hard to achieve, due to the noise originated by abnormal local events. In particular, mass social events (e.g., concerts, conventions, sport events..) have a strong impact on traffic demand. In this paper, a data-driven model to estimate the impact of local events on cellular traffic is presented. The model is trained with a large dataset of geotagged social events taken from public event databases and hourly traffic data from a live Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. The resulting model is combined with a traffic forecast module based on a multi-task deep-learning architecture to predict the hourly traffic series with scheduled mass events. Model assessment is performed over a real dataset created with geolocated social event information collected from public event directories and hourly cell traffic measurements during two months in a LTE network. Results show that the addition of the proposed model significantly improves traffic forecasts in the presence of massive events.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a network traffic forecasting model based on long-term intuitionistic fuzzy time series (LT-IFTS) is proposed. It describes the fuzziness and uncertainty of network flow and improves the traffic forecasting performance. The multi-input multi-output (MIMO) intuitionistic fuzzy time series forecasting model, namely, (p−q) IFTS is defined. An intuitionistic fuzzy time series vectors clustering algorithm based on vector variation pattern is given. The cluster centroid in the proposed model is quite different from the traditional method. As a kind of typical time series data, the network flow forecasting system is constructed particularly. Characteristic intuitionistic fuzzy is a practical method to manage the fuzziness and uncertainty of network traffic data. The network traffic data is intuitionistic fuzzified and vector quantized. The time series vectors are gathered based on the improved intuitionistic fuzzy c-means clustering and matched with centroids by coordinate translation. Compared with other traditional forecasting models, the improved FCM clustering algorithm increases discrimination of time series segments. In addition, the long-term scheme improves forecasting efficiency and reduces computational complexity than other single-output models. In experiments, the proposed model and relevant models are implemented on four different scales network traffic dataset from MAWI. The experiment result indicates that the proposed model is with better generalization performance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recently, with the rapid development of deep learning models, traffic analysis using image datasets recently has attracted more attention. Specifically, the network traffic can be represented to images as the input for deep learning models to provide various applications (e.g. Spatio-Temporal traffic forecasting). In this study, we propose a new image generation approach for traffic density classification in terms of large-scale road network. Particularly, traffic volume and speed are at certain areas able to be measured by using surveillance systems (e.g. loop detectors). However, measuring the density is difficult which depends on the spatial correlation from the perspective of the network. Consequently, an effective image generation approach, based on information arrival and departure time of vehicles, is proposed to deal with this problem. Regarding the experiment, traffic density classification using a convolutional neural network is executed on roadside equipment data of 11 continuous intersections for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - We investigate spatio-temporal event analysis using point processes. Inferring the dynamics of event sequences spatiotemporally has many practical applications including crime prediction, socialmedia analysis, and traffic forecasting. In particular, we focus on spatio-temporal Hawkes processes that are commonly used due to their capability to capture excitations between event occurrences. We introduce a novel inference framework based on randomized transformations and gradient descent to learn the process. We replace the spatial kernel calculations by randomized Fourier feature-based transformations. The introduced randomization by this representation provides flexibility while modeling the spatial excitation between events. Moreover, the system described by the process is expressed within closed-form in terms of scalable matrix operations. During the optimization, we use maximum likelihood estimation approach and gradient descent while properly handling positivity and orthonormality constraints. The experiment results show the improvements achieved by the introduced method in terms of fitting capability in synthetic and real-life datasetswith respect to the conventional inference methods in the spatio-temporal Hawkes process literature.We also analyze the triggering interactions between event types and how their dynamics change in space and time through the interpretation of learned parameters. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - Short-term traffic forecasting based on deep learning methods, especially recurrent neural networks (RNN), has received much attention in recent years. However, the potential of RNN-based models in traffic forecasting has not yet been fully exploited in terms of the predictive power of spatial–temporal data and the capability of handling missing data. In this paper, we focus on RNN-based models and attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate RNN and its variants into traffic prediction models. A stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM network architecture (SBU-LSTM) is proposed to assist the design of neural network structures for traffic state forecasting. As a key component of the architecture, the bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) is exploited to capture the forward and backward temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data. To deal with missing values in spatial–temporal data, we also propose a data imputation mechanism in the LSTM structure (LSTM-I) by designing an imputation unit to infer missing values and assist traffic prediction. The bidirectional version of LSTM-I is incorporated in the SBU-LSTM architecture. Two real-world network-wide traffic state datasets are used to conduct experiments and published to facilitate further traffic prediction research. The prediction performance of multiple types of multi-layer LSTM or BDLSTM models is evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM architecture, especially the two-layer BDLSTM network, can achieve superior performance for the network-wide traffic prediction in both accuracy and robustness. Further, comprehensive comparison results show that the proposed data imputation mechanism in the RNN-based models can achieve outstanding prediction performance when the model's input data contains different patterns of missing values. © 2020

AB  - It is very important for traffic management to be able to correctly recognize traffic trends from large historical traffic data, particularly the congestion pattern and road collisions. This can be used to reduce congestion, improve protection, and increase the accuracy of traffic forecasting. Choosing the correct and effective text mining methodology helps speed up and reduces the time and effort needed to retrieve valuable knowledge and information for future prediction and decision-making processes. Modeling collisions or accident risk has also been an important aspect of traffic management and road safety, as it helps recognize problems and causes that contribute to a higher risk of accidents, promotes treatment delivery, and reduces crashes to save more lives and avoid road congestion. Therefore, this work-study proposed a model that relies on the different text mining methodology to determine clearly what circumstances affect and who is involved more in an accident. Using different classification and machine learning techniques applied to get the optimum classifiers used in this model. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed models outperform Prayag Tiwari’s Research Work related to the Leeds UK Dataset. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Spatiotemporal models are a popular tool for urban traffic forecasting, and their correct specification is a challenging task. Temporal aggregation of traffic sensor data series is a critical component of model specification, which determines the spatial structure and affects models’ forecasting accuracy. Through extensive experiments with real-world data, we investigated the effects of the selected temporal aggregation level for forecasting performance of different spatiotemporal model specifications. A set of analysed models include travel-time-based and correlation-based spatially restricted vector autoregressive models, compared to classical univariate and multivariate time series models. Research experiments are executed in several dimensions: temporal aggregation levels, forecasting horizons (one-step and multi-step forecasts), spatial complexity (sequential and complex spatial structures), the spatial restriction approach (unrestricted, travel-time-based and correlation-based), and series transformation (original and detrended traffic volumes). The obtained results demonstrate the crucial role of the temporal aggregation level for identification of the spatiotemporal traffic flow structure and selection of the best model specification. We conclude that the common research practice of an arbitrary selection of the temporal aggregation level could lead to incorrect conclusions on optimal model specification. Thus, we recommend extending the traffic forecasting methodology by validation of existing and newly developed model specifications for different temporal aggregation levels. Additionally, we provide empirical results on the selection of the optimal temporal aggregation level for the discussed spatiotemporal models for different forecasting horizons. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Transport is considered to be a major contributor to emissions, resulting in a deterioration of local air quality and contributing to global climate change. The present paper focuses on how passenger flights departing from German airports contribute to global climate change. We describe in detail, how traffic forecasts for three scenarios entitled Reference, Free Play and Regulated Shift have been developed and how the resultant emissions have been quantified. Subsequently, we applied a climate model, providing insights into the very long-term climate effects under different assumptions on emissions up to the year 2100. The modelling framework shows that the development of emissions results from complex interactions of demand development and supply decisions, which highly influence the climate impact. With this paper, we show that an integrated, multi-disciplinary analysis can create valuable indicators and advice for transport policy decisions. © 2020 Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt DLR

AB  - Travel time is one of the most critical parameters in proactive traffic management and the deployment of advanced traveler information systems. This paper proposes a hybrid model named LSTM-CNN for predicting the travel time of highways by integrating the long short-term memory (LSTM) and the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the attention mechanism and the residual network. The highway is divided into multiple segments by considering the traffic diversion and the relative location of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR). There are four steps in this hybrid approach. First, the average travel time of each segment in each interval is calculated from ANPR and fed into LSTM in the form of a multidimensional array. Second, the attention mechanism is adopted to combine the hidden layer of LSTM with dynamic temporal weights. Third, the residual network is introduced to increase the network depth and overcome the vanishing gradient problem, which consists of three pairs of one-dimensional convolutional layers (Conv1D) and batch normalization (BatchNorm) with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function. Finally, a series of Conv1D layers is connected to extract features further and reduce dimensionality. The proposed LSTM-CNN approach is tested on the three-month ANPR data of a real-world 39.25 km highway with four pairs of ANPR detectors of the uplink and downlink, Zhejiang, China. The experimental results indicate that LSTM-CNN learns spatial, temporal, and depth information better than the state-of-the-art traffic forecasting models, so LSTM-CNN can predict more accurate travel time. Moreover, LSTM-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in nonrecurrent prediction, multistep-ahead prediction, and long-term prediction. LSTM-CNN is a promising model with scalability and portability for highway traffic prediction and can be further extended to improve the performance of the advanced traffic management system (ATMS) and advanced traffic information system (ATIS).  © 2021 Wenjun Du et al.

AB  - We evaluated the accuracy of several classical statistical methods of Time series forecasting with ground truth dataset which was obtained from Kaggle web traffic forecasting competition hosted by Google. A novel way of seasonal, trend and cycle pattern decomposing method was used for the specific time series daily data. We proposed using the combination of four traditional methods to reduce the RMSE and thus achieved better forecasting accuracy. Results showed error rate was lowered down 10 to 20 percentage points. After studying the characteristics of the web traffic time series, we presented the Generative Adversarial Model (GAN) with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) as generator and deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as discriminator to forecast the web traffic time series. The forecasting performances was compared among the traditional statistical methods and the deep generative adversarial network. We concluded from experiments there was no remarkable difference for this specific times series forecasting accuracy using these two kinds of methods. © 2020

AB  - An economic model of integrated Photovoltaic - Battery Swapping Station (PV-BSS) is developed in this work. Speed-variable charging taking into account battery degradation models of modern lithium-ion batteries is combined with weather and road traffic forecasts for the first time to maximize the economic and environmental impacts of this emerging technology. Annual net revenue is used as an objective function, and the power balance, charging rate limit, and consumer demand are set as model constraints. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm complemented with non-linear programming features is applied to optimize the operation of the integrated PV-BSS. The extensive model developed in this work let us propose an optimized speed variable charging method with clear economic and environmental advantages over the other methods considered in the literature so far. A case study with specific values of input parameters fed into the model is performed to verify the applicability of the model and the reliability of its predictions. The case study confirms that the proposed speed-variable charging method dispatches the PV-generated energy in an intelligent manner and shifts the energy of the grid from the peak to the valley. The model is easily extendable, allows implementation of additional metrics of interest and could be an important enabler of the upcoming smart grid revolution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the recent advances in deep learning, data-driven methods have shown compelling performance in various application domains enabling the Smart Cities paradigm. Leveraging spatial–temporal data from multiple sources for (citywide) traffic forecasting is a key to strengthen the smart city management in areas such as urban traffic control, abnormal event detection, etc. Existing approaches of traffic flow prediction mainly rely on the development of various deep neural networks –e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks such as ResNet are used for modeling spatial dependencies among different regions, whereas recurrent neural networks are increasingly implemented for temporal dynamics modeling. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches suffer from limitations of intensive computations, lack of capabilities to properly deal with missing values, and simplistic integration of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel urban flow prediction framework by generalizing the hidden states of the model with continuous-time dynamics of the latent states using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we introduce a discretize-then-optimize approach to improve and balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. It not only guarantees the prediction error but also provides high flexibility for decision-makers. Furthermore, we investigate the factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that affect the city traffic volume and use separate neural networks to extract and disentangle the influencing factors, which avoids the brute-force data fusion in previous works. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, while requiring significantly less memory cost and fewer model parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Obtaining accurate information about future traffic flows of all links in a traffic network is of great importance for traffic management and control applications. This research studies two particular problems in traffic forecasting: (1) capture the dynamic and non-local spatial correlation between traffic links and (2) model the dynamics of temporal dependency for accurate multiple steps ahead predictions. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning framework named Spatial-Temporal Sequence to Sequence model (STSeq2Seq). This model builds on sequence to sequence (seq2seq) architecture to capture temporal feature and relies on graph convolution for aggregating spatial information. Moreover, STSeq2Seq defines and constructs Pattern-aware Adjacency Matrix (PAM) based on pair-wise similarity of the recent traffic patterns on traffic links and integrates it into graph convolution operation. It also deploys a novel seq2sesq architecture which couples a convolutional encoder and a recurrent decoder with attention mechanism for dynamic modeling of long-range dependence between different time steps. We conduct extensive experiments using two publicly-available large-scale traffic datasets and compare STSeq2Seq with other baseline models. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in terms of various error measures. The ablation study verifies the effectiveness of PAMs in capturing dynamic non-local spatial correlation and the superiority of proposed seq2seq architecture in modeling non-stationary temporal dependency for multiple steps ahead prediction. Furthermore, qualitative analysis is conducted on PAMs as well as the attention weights for model interpretation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and increased availability of the road sensors allow for fine-grained traffic forecasting, which is of particular importance toward building an intelligent transportation system. In the literature, recent efforts have applied various deep learning methods for traffic forecasting, e.g., leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for spatial dependency modeling, and utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for capturing temporal dynamics. However, most of the existing approaches assume that spatial correlations are static and temporal correlations have only sequential dependencies and do not consider temporal periodicity of traffic across multiple time steps. The real challenge lies in using the dynamic spatiotemporal correlations while also considering the influence of the nontraffic-related factors, such as time-of-day and weekday-or-weekend in the learning architectures. We propose a novel framework titled 'reinforced spatial-temporal attention graph (RSTAG) neural networks' for traffic prediction. Our method captures dynamic spatial correlations through diffusion network graphs, while temporal dependencies are represented through the sequence-to-sequence model with an attention mechanism. In addition, we utilize the policy gradient to update the model parameters while largely alleviating the exposure bias issue that exists in previous traffic prediction models. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale traffic data sets collected from the road sensor networks in Los Angles and Bay Area of California. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - – The intellectualization of transportation system is a relevant task for solving traffic-related problems such as vehicle traffic management and modern transport system improvement. The purpose of this work was to design a competitive pathway for real transport system to optimize the route planning. Modeling of the transport system refers to the problem of finding the K-shortest sustainable pathway in a multimodal network. The solution to this problem was fulfilled by applying a hybrid algorithm of an ant colony based on a differential evolution approach to the pheromone renewal and the division of the colony into teams. Experimental results showed that an advanced ants colony algorithm is highly efficient even with quite a small population of the colony. The obtained results were compared with those of the conventional ant colony algorithm. Due to its high efficiency, the elaborated method is applicable in improving the quality of the entire road network, especially in congestions and traffic jams, taking into account real-time traffic information. © 2020 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.

AB  - Road traffic forecasting is crucial in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To achieve accurate results, it is necessary to model the dynamic nature and the complex non-linear dependencies governing traffic. The goal is particularly challenging when the prediction involves more than just one traffic variable. This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning model, called AST-MTL, to perform multi-horizon predictions of the traffic flow and speed at the road network scale. The strategy combines a multilayer fully-connected neural network (FNN) and a multi-head attention mechanism to learn related tasks while improving generalization performance. The model also includes the graph convolutional network (GCNs) and the gated recurrent unit network (GRUs) to extract the spatial and temporal features of traffic conditions. Our experiments employ new sets of GPS data, called OBU data, to perform traffic prediction in the freeway and urban contexts. The experimental results prove our model can effectively perform multi-horizon traffic forecasting for different types of roads and outperform state-of-the-art models.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate and real-time traffic forecasting plays an important role in the intelligent traffic system and is of great significance for urban traffic planning, traffic management, and traffic control. However, traffic forecasting has always been considered an 'open' scientific issue, owing to the constraints of urban road network topological structure and the law of dynamic change with time. To capture the spatial and temporal dependences simultaneously, we propose a novel neural network-based traffic forecasting method, the temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN) model, which is combined with the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). Specifically, the GCN is used to learn complex topological structures for capturing spatial dependence and the gated recurrent unit is used to learn dynamic changes of traffic data for capturing temporal dependence. Then, the T-GCN model is employed to traffic forecasting based on the urban road network. Experiments demonstrate that our T-GCN model can obtain the spatio-temporal correlation from traffic data and the predictions outperform state-of-art baselines on real-world traffic datasets. Our tensorflow implementation of the T-GCN is available at https://www.github.com/lehaifeng/T-GCN. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Network traffic classification is an important task for any current data network. There any many possible classification targets for the traffic, but we have considered as especially important the activity state of a connection and the identification of elephant flows (few connections carrying most of the traffic). With these detection targets, this work presents a modification of the gaNet architecture for classification. gaNet is an additive network model formed by ‘learning blocks’ that are stacked iteratively following the principles of boosting models. The original gaNet model is intended for regression, being the purpose of this work to show that it can be extended to classification under several adaptations. The resulting architecture is a generic additive network applicable to any supervised classification problem (gaNet-C). To obtain experimental results, the model is applied to a type-of-traffic forecast problem using real IoT traffic from a mobile operator. The paper presents a comprehensive comparison of results between the proposed new model and many alternative algorithms in terms of classification and performance metrics. The proposed classifier can perform a k-step ahead detection forecast based exclusively on a limited time-series of previous values for each network connection. The results include two very different challenges: detection forecast of active connections and elephant flows; showing that, in both cases, the proposed algorithm presents state of the art results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is a fundamental and challenging task in the field of intelligent transportation. Accurate forecasting not only depends on the historical traffic flow information but also needs to consider the influence of a variety of external factors, such as weather conditions and surrounding POI distribution. Recently, spatiotemporal models integrating graph convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks have become traffic forecasting research hotspots and have made significant progress. However, few works integrate external factors. Therefore, based on the assumption that introducing external factors can enhance the spatiotemporal accuracy in predicting traffic and improving interpretability, we propose an attribute-augmented spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (AST-GCN). We model the external factors as dynamic attributes and static attributes and design an attribute-augmented unit to encode and integrate those factors into the spatiotemporal graph convolution model. Experiments on real datasets show the effectiveness of considering external information on traffic speed forecasting tasks when compared with traditional traffic prediction methods. Moreover, under different attribute-augmented schemes and prediction horizon settings, the forecasting accuracy of the AST-GCN is higher than that of the baselines. The source code of the AST-GCN is available at https://github.com/lehaifeng/T-GCN/AST-GCN.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research and applications benefit from accurate short-term traffic state forecasting. To improve the forecasting accuracy, this paper proposes a deep learning based multitask learning Gated Recurrent Units (MTL-GRU) with residual mappings. To enhance the performance of the MTL-GRU, feature engineering is introduced to select the most informative features for the forecasting. Then, based on real-world datasets, numerical results show that the MTL-GRU can well estimate traffic flow and speed simultaneously, and performs better than other counterparts. Experiments also show that the deep learning based MTL-GRU model can overpower the bottleneck caused by enlarging training datasets and continue to gain benefits. The results suggest the proposed MTL-GRU model with residual mappings is promising to forecast short-term traffic state. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The French standard governing occupanckes dedicated for gatherings of individuals and institutions receiving the public, including railway stations and tunnels was used in the design of Cairo’s transit network, which consists of three lines connected through three existing interchange connections and one that is currently under construction. There is a lack of studies quantifying passenger evacuation in relation to Cairo transit, especially with regard to the interchange connections. This study assessed the viability of the evacuation methods applied to the design of interchange connections in Egypt. The emergency evacuation procedures for the future interchange connection layout between Lines 1 and 3 were assessed using the French standard and NFPA 130 Standard for Fixed Guideway Transit and Passenger Rail Systems analytical methods. The analysis accounts for the traffic forecast as presented in the Egyptian company for operation and maintenance report for Line 1 and the feasibility study of Line 3. The results demonstrated that the connection was compliant with the French standard, but it did not fully meet NFPA requirements. It was concluded that there is still room for enhancement and for gaps to be considered. Recommendations include undertaking investigations into passenger characteristics and behavior in the context of passenger flow in emergency situations using approaches such as virtual research and field surveys, and simulation techniques. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.

AB  - Abstract: Accurate and timely traffic forecasting plays an important role in the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Traffic data are the main information source for various tasks solved as part of the ITS, including traffic management, urban planning, route guidance, and others. Due to the spatial and temporal nonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow, traffic forecasting problem remains a subject of research. In this paper, we design a deep-learning framework that combines convolution operations on graph data with recurrent neural networks to solve the short-term traffic data forecasting problem. The proposed model takes into account recent, daily, and weekly periodic time series to capture different patterns in traffic flow. The experimental study of the model conducted on publicly available real-world datasets shows that the proposed model outperforms other baseline methods. © 2021, Allerton Press, Inc.

AB  - The traffic state in an urban transportation network is determined via spatio-temporal traffic propagation. In early traffic forecasting studies, time-series models were adopted to accommodate autocorrelations between traffic states. The incorporation of spatial correlations into the forecasting of traffic states, however, involved a computational burden. Deep learning technologies were recently introduced to traffic forecasting in order to accommodate the spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states. In the present study, we devised a novel graph-based neural network that expanded the existing graph convolutional neural network (GCN). The proposed model allowed us to differentiate the intensity of connecting to neighbor roads, unlike existing GCNs that give equal weight to each neighbor road. A plausible model architecture that mimicked real traffic propagation was established based on the graph convolution. The domain knowledge was efficiently incorporated into a neural network architecture. The present study also employed a generative adversarial framework to ensure that a forecasted traffic state could be as realistic as possible considering the joint probabilistic density of real traffic states. The forecasting performance of the proposed model surpassed that of the original GCN model, and the estimated adjacency matrices revealed the hidden nature of real traffic propagation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic is still spreading around the world and seriously imperils humankind's health. This swift spread has caused the public to panic and look to scientists for answers. Fortunately, these scientists already have a wealth of data - the Covid-19 reports that each country releases, reports with valuable spatial-temporal properties. These data point toward some key actions that humans can take in their fight against Covid-19. Technically, the Covid-19 records can be described as sequences, which represent spatial-temporal linkages among the data elements with graph structure. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, the Interaction-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (IT-GCN), to analyze pandemic data. Specifically, IT-GCN introduces ARIMA into GCN to model the data which originate on nodes in a graph, indicating the severity of the pandemic in different cities. Instead of regular spatial topology, we construct the graph nodes with the vectors via ARIMA parameterization to find out the interaction topology underlying in the pandemic data. Experimental results show that IT-GCN is able to capture the comprehensive interaction-temporal topology and achieve well-performed short-term prediction of the Covid-19 daily infected cases in the United States. Our framework outperforms state-of-art baselines in terms of MAE, RMSE and MAPE. We believe that IT-GCN is a valid and reasonable method to forecast the Covid-19 daily infected cases and other related time-series. Moreover, the prediction can assist in improving containment policies. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The process of air transport liberalization in Colombia began in 1991. Liberalization entailed the entry of private capital into the airport sector which subsequently led, in several temporary phases, to the privatization of the country’s main airports. Simultaneously, new air operators entered the market. This new market situation, supported by the complete deregulation of airfares, generated a dynamic and sustained growth of air transport in Colombia for two decades. Within the context of post-liberalization, this article presents a forecast (medium-term - 5 years period) of air traffic in the country’s main airport using DLMs (Dynamic Linear Models). It has the following advantages vs. the usual forecast calculation methodologies: It detects stochastic tendencies that are hidden in the time series. It also detects structural changes that allow estimating the variable effect of exogenous shocks over time without increasing the number of parameters. From the results obtained, it should be noted that the application of DLMs presents MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) values below 1%, which guarantees predictions of higher accuracy and thus introduces a new alternative model to develop reliable forecasts in air transport, at least in the medium-term. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Short-term traffic forecasting is an important part of contemporary intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, based on echo state network optimized by improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (ESN-IFOA), a model is proposed to provide a five-minute forecast of traffic volume. In IFOA, parallel searching strategy and uniform crossover operator are applied to enhance searching range and communication between swarms. Simultaneously, the source allocation strategy is proposed to calculate the number of fruit flies generated by each swarm in the next iteration. The five main parameters of ESN are optimized by the proposed IFOA. Massive of prediction results and algorithm comparisons demonstrates that ESN-IFOA has very good forecasting ability for the five-minutes forecast of traffic volume. © 2019

AB  - Efforts devoted to mitigate the effects of road traffic congestion have been conducted since 1970s. Nowadays, there is a need for prominent solutions capable of mining information from messy and multidimensional road traffic data sets with few modeling constraints. In that sense, we propose a unique and versatile model to address different major challenges of traffic forecasting in an unsupervised manner. We formulate the road traffic forecasting problem as a latent variable model, assuming that traffic data is not generated randomly but from a latent space with fewer dimensions containing the underlying characteristics of traffic. We solve the problem by proposing a variational autoencoder (VAE) model to learn how traffic data are generated and inferred, while validating it against three different real-world traffic data sets. Under this framework, we propose an online unsupervised imputation method for unobserved traffic data with missing values. Additionally, taking advantage of the low dimension latent space learned, we compress the traffic data before applying a prediction model obtaining improvements in the forecasting accuracy. Finally, given that the model not only learns useful forecasting features but also meaningful characteristics, we explore the latent space as a tool for model and data selection and traffic anomaly detection from the point of view of traffic modelers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Short-term traffic prediction consists a crucial component in intelligent transportation systems. With the explosion of automated traffic monitoring sensors and the flourishing of deep learning techniques, a growing body of deep neural network models have been employed to tackle this problem. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks have demonstrated their advantages in modeling and predicting the spatiotemporal evolution of traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional LSTM neural network architecture for multi-lane short-term traffic prediction. Compared to existing methods, we highlight the importance of (1) applying multiple features to characterize traffic conditions; (2) explicitly considering the routing between neighbouring lanes and downstream/upstream traffics; and (3) predicting multiple time-step traffic in a rolling-prediction manner. Experiments on 10 months 5-minute interval observations of the US I-101 Northern freeway at California Bay Area verify the proposed model. The results show that our model has considerable advantages in predicting multi-lane short-term traffic flow. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic prediction is a vital part of intelligent transportation systems. The ability of traffic risk prediction is of great significance to prevent traffic accidents and reduce the damages in a proactive way. Because of the complexity, uncertainty and dynamics of spatiotemporal dependence of traffic flow, accurate traffic state prediction becomes a challenging issue. Most neural networks are compute intensive and memory intensive, making them hard to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. A real-time and high-compressed video object detection structure is proposed. For traffic prediction, many previous studies only explore the utility of a single factor in their prediction and a few multi-factor researches are conducted. Other studies focus on the temporal distribution of traffic flow, ignoring the spatial correlation. And some methods based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) do not consider the dynamics of graph structure which is a crucial factor to traffic prediction. In this paper, we analyze and process the onboard video captured by the dashboard camera real time. A high accurate deep learning model called varying spatiotemporal graph-based convolution model (VSTGC) is proposed to express the spatiotemporal structures and forecast future traffic safety trends from previous traffic flow. The traffic detailed features (such as vehicle type, braking state, whether changing lanes or not) and external variables (such as weather, time and road condition) are extracted from our big datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the VSTGC model on real-world traffic datasets. Experiments on our real traffic dataset show that the proposed model performs competitive performances over the other state-of-the-art approaches. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is one of the most important use cases related to smart cities. In addition to assisting traffic management authorities, traffic forecasting can help drivers to choose the best path to their destinations. Accurate traffic forecasting is a basic requirement for traffic management. We propose a traffic forecasting approach that utilizes air pollution and atmospheric parameters. Air pollution levels are often associated with traffic intensity, and much work is already available in which air pollution has been predicted using road traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, an attempt to improve forecasting road traffic using air pollution and atmospheric parameters is not yet available in the literature. In our preliminary experiments, we found out the relation between traffic intensity, air pollution, and atmospheric parameters. Therefore, we believe that addition of air pollutants and atmospheric parameters can improve the traffic forecasting. Our method uses air pollution gases, including CO, NO, NO2, NOx, and O3 . We chose these gases because they are associated with road traffic. Some atmospheric parameters, including pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed have also been considered, as these parameters can play an important role in the dispersion of the above-mentioned gases. Data related to traffic flow, air pollution, and the atmosphere were collected from the open data portal of Madrid, Spain. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was used in this paper to perform traffic forecasting. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Due to the numerous factors that affect the air passenger traffic in the air transportation market and the randomness of various factors, in addition, the relationship between it and the air passenger traffic is very complicated, so the air passenger traffic forecast in the air transportation market has always been difficult to solve problem. This research mainly discusses the prediction model of air transportation management based on the intelligent algorithm of wireless network communication. This article uses the wireless network communication intelligent algorithm, comprehensively considers the influence of the GDP growth rate, population growth rate, total import and export volume, and other factors on the air transportation market, and draws a relatively complete forecasting model of aviation business volume. In this paper, we use an equal-weight method, linear combination model method, and Bayesian combination model method when selecting the combination forecasting method (these three methods). Because of the parallelism, robustness, nonlinearity, and other characteristics of the Bayesian network method, it adapts to the complex and highly nonlinear characteristics between air passenger traffic and its influencing factors. In the comprehensive prediction of the single model, the different information contained in the single model is used to achieve different combined prediction effects. The economic information and forecasting angle of the system can reduce systematic forecasting errors and optimize the prognostic results, which can make us more intuitively understand the difference of forecasting results brought by different combination forecasting methods. The Theil inequality coefficient of the ARIMA model is 0.004874, and the average absolute percentage error is 0.005914. This research will play a certain guiding role in the development of China's civil aviation industry.  © 2021 Jiezhuoma La et al.

AB  - Traffic forecasting approaches are critical to developing adaptive strategies for mobility. Traffic patterns have complex spatial and temporal dependencies that make accurate forecasting on large highway networks a challenging task. Recently, diffusion convolutional recurrent neural networks (DCRNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in traffic forecasting by capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the traffic. Despite the promising results, however, applying DCRNNs for large highway networks still remains elusive because of computational and memory bottlenecks. This paper presents an approach for implementing a DCRNN for a large highway network that overcomes these limitations. This approach uses a graphpartitioning method to decompose a large highway network into smaller networks and trains them independently. The efficacy of the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN approach to model the traffic on a large California highway network with 11,160 sensor locations is demonstrated. An overlapping-nodes approach for the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN is developed to include sensor locations from partitions that are geographically close to a given partition. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the DCRNN model can be used to forecast the speed and flow simultaneously and that the forecasted values preserve fundamental traffic flow dynamics. This approach to developing DCRNN models that represent large highway networks can be a potential core capability in advanced highway traffic monitoring systems, where a trained DCRNN model forecasting traffic at all sensor locations can be used to adjust traffic management strategies proactively based on anticipated future conditions. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is an important research area in Intelligent Transportation Systems that is focused on anticipating traffic in order to mitigate congestion. In this work we propose a deep neural network that simultaneously extracts the spatial features of traffic, using graph convolution, and its temporal features by means of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells to make both short-term and long-term predictions. The model is trained and tested using sparse trajectory (GPS) data coming from the ride-hailing service of DiDi in the cities of Xi'an and Chengdu in China. Besides, presenting the deep neural network, we also propose a data-reduction technique based on temporal correlation to select the most relevant road links to be used as input. Combining the suggested approaches, our model obtains better results compared to high-performance algorithms for traffic forecasting, such as LSTM or the algorithms presented in the TRANSFOR19 forecasting competition. The model is capable of maintaining its performance over different time-horizons from 5 min to up to 4 h with multi-step predictions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forecasting short-term traffic flow using historical data is a difficult goal to achieve due to the randomness of the event. Due to the lack of a solid approach to short-term traffic prediction, the researchers are still working on novel approaches. This study aims to develop an algorithm that dynamically updates the training set of models in order to make more accurate predictions. For this purpose, an algorithm called Periodic Clustering and Prediction (PCP) has been developed for use in short-term traffic forecasting. In this study, PCP was used to improve Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) predictive performance by improving the training set of ANN to predict short-term traffic flow using selected clusters. A large amount of traffic data collected from the US and UK motorways was used to determine the PCP ability to increase the ANN performance. The robustness of the proposed approach was determined by the performance measures used in the literature and the mean prediction errors of PCP were significantly below other approaches. In addition, the studies showed that the percentage errors of PCP predictions decreased in response to increasing traffic flow values. Considering the obtained positive results, this method can be used in real-time traffic control systems and in different areas needed. © 2020, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

AB  - Long short-term memory networks (LSTM) produces promising results in the prediction of traffic flows. However, LSTM needs large numbers of data to produce satisfactory results. Therefore, the effect of LSTM training set size on performance and optimum training set size for short-term traffic flow prediction problems were investigated in this study. To achieve this, the numbers of data in the training set was set between 480 and 2800, and the prediction performance of the LSTMs trained using these adjusted training sets was measured. In addition, LSTM prediction results were compared with nonlinear autoregressive neural networks (NAR) trained using the same training sets. Consequently, it was seen that the increase in LSTM's training cluster size increased performance to a certain point. However, after this point, the performance decreased. Three main results emerged in this study: First, the optimum training set size for LSTM significantly improves the prediction performance of the model. Second, LSTM makes short-term traffic forecasting better than NAR. Third, LSTM predictions fluctuate less than the NAR model following instant traffic flow changes. © 2021 Scientific Journal of Silesian University of Technology. Series Transport.

AB  - Predicting traffic disturbances is a challenging problem in urban cities. Emergency vehicles (EV) is one of the biggest disturbances that affect traffic fluidity. The goal of this paper is to provide a machine learning application to deal with emergency cases in traffic networks. Particularly, we investigate the use of deep learning techniques coupled with Artificial Immune System to tackle the issue of EV guidance at signalized intersections. To accomplish this goal, we develop a traffic signal control system capable to estimate traffic status, guide EV to reach their destinations while assuming better traffic condition, control traffic signals, and adapt to new disturbances. For traffic forecasting, the suggested system inherits the advantages of convolutional neural networks, classification, and long short term memory. To control traffic signals, the suggested system uses the immune memory algorithm. To enhance and adapt control decisions to traffic disturbances, the suggested system uses a continuous learning approach assumed by an adapted reinforcement learning algorithm. Assessments using well-known algorithms from the literature are detailed in this work. The benchmarking algorithms are the preemptive longest queue first matching weight matrix system, the pre-emptive immune memory algorithm inspired case-based reasoning, and the preemptive optimized stage based fixed time algorithm. Experiments show a competitive performance of the suggested system compared to benchmarking algorithms. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a spatial-temporal deep learning network, termed ST-TrafficNet, for traffic flow forecasting. Recent deep learning methods highly relate accurate predetermined graph structure for the complex spatial dependencies of traffic flow, and ineffectively harvest high dimensional temporal features of the traffic flow. In this paper, a novel multi-diffusion convolution block constructed by an attentive diffusion convolution and bidirectional diffusion convolution is proposed, which is capable to extract precise potential spatial dependencies. Moreover, a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) block is adopted to capture high-dimensional temporal features. By integrating the two blocks, the ST-TrafficNet can learn the spatial-temporal dependencies of intricate traffic data accurately. The performance of the ST-TrafficNet has been evaluated on two real-world benchmark datasets by comparing it with three commonly-used methods and seven state-of-the-art ones. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the proposed method outperform not only the commonly-used methods, but also the state-of-the-art ones in 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min time-steps. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In order to achieve the load balancing between network nodes, improve the utilization of system resources and network throughput, and reduce network delay. Therefore, based on the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol, this paper proposes an improved protocol of OLSR based on traffic load balancing and QoS. OLSR-TLB protocol takes the traffic load balancing and QoS into account. For real-time traffic, focus on the traffic load of the access point. If the access point traffic load is too high, it cannot be connected with the routing. However, for non-real-time traffic, QoS but not traffic load is considered, making routing decisions based on hop counts. In addition, the traffic service is divided into real-time traffic and non-real-time traffic. The former considers the real-time, making routing decisions based on traffic load, while the latter considers QoS, making routing decisions based on hop counts. Simulation results show that the proposed OLSR-TLB protocol can effectively improve the throughput and reduce the delay performance. Compared with the traditional OLSR protocol, the throughput of OLSR-TLB protocol is improved to 3.5Mbps, and the delay is reduced to 50 ms. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is an important prerequisite for the application of intelligent transportation systems in urban traffic networks. The existing works adopted RNN and CNN/GCN, among which GCRN is the state-of-the-art work, to characterize the temporal and spatial correlation of traffic flows. However, it is hard to apply GCRN to the large-scale road networks due to high computational complexity. To address this problem, we propose abstracting the road network into a geometric graph and building a Fast Graph Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (FastGCRNN) to model the spatial-temporal dependencies of traffic flow. Specifically, we use FastGCN unit to efficiently capture the topological relationship between the roads and the surrounding roads in the graph with reducing the computational complexity through importance sampling, combine GRU unit to capture the temporal dependency of traffic flow, and embed the spatiotemporal features into Seq2Seq based on the Encoder-Decoder framework. Experiments on large-scale traffic data sets illustrate that the proposed method can greatly reduce computational complexity and memory consumption while maintaining relatively high accuracy.  © 2020 Ya Zhang et al.

AB  - In order to improve the prediction accuracy of railway passenger traffic, an ARIMA model and FSVR are combined to propose a hybrid prediction method. The ARIMA prediction model is established based on the known railway passenger traffic data, and then, the ARIMA prediction results are used as the training set of the FSVR method. At the same time, the air price and historical passenger traffic data are introduced to predict the future passenger traffic, to realize the mixed prediction of railway passenger traffic. The case study demonstrates that the hybrid prediction method can effectively improve the prediction performance of railway passenger traffic. Compared with the single ARIMA method, the hybrid prediction method improves the delay of the prediction results. Compared with the FSVR prediction result, the hybrid prediction method greatly reduces the errors in the extreme points of passenger traffic and long-term prediction. The relevant research results of this paper provide a useful reference for the prediction of railway passenger traffic.  © 2021 Meng Ge et al.

AB  - Knowledge about future optical network traffic can be beneficial for network operators in terms of decreasing an operational cost due to efficient resource management. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be employed for forecasting traffic with high accuracy. In this paper we describe a methodology for predicting traffic in a dynamic optical network with service function chains (SFC). We assume that SFC is based on the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigm. Moreover, other type of traffic, i.e. regular traffic, can also occur in the network. As a proof of effectiveness of our methodology we present and discuss numerical results of experiments run on three benchmark networks. We examine six ML classifiers. Our research shows that it is possible to predict a future traffic in an optical network, where SFC can be distinguished. However, there is no one universal classifier that can be used for each network. Choice of an ML algorithm should be done based on a network traffic characteristics analysis.  © 2020 Daniel Szostak et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Modeling the unprecedented traffic flow data generated by Intelligent Transportation Systems can boost the innovation-capacity of the transportation management systems to drive informed decision-making. Thus, this paper attempts to simulate traffic forecasting techniques that can be adopted in the Philippines to make fact-based decisions into accurate and effective traffic management schemes. In this research, a schematic framework is introduced organized into three stages (Preprocessing, Model Identification and Estimation, and Model Checking) sequentially arranged to comprehensively estimate the best-appropriate model to forecast traffic flow using ARIMA and GARCH models. The Model Identification and Estimation is the conditional stage in the framework that pre-determines if hybrid modeling is necessary based on the given datasets. Various accuracy metrics are also used to find the “best” model and select the optimal values for ARIMA and GARCH models. The proposed framework is simulated in R Programming using the vehicular traffic flow datasets at North Avenue, EDSA northbound, Manila, Philippines. The resulting models, consist of the best fit ARIMA (1,1,3) and GARCH (1,2), are combined as the hybrid model and compared using its prediction results. Based on the visual simulation data, the prediction accuracy result of the ARIMA model outperforms the combined ARIMA-GARCH model given the actual data. Conclusively, the simulation performance provides proof to suggest that the forecasting models are timely tools to predict future traffic flow and aid in making better traffic inventions and schemes. © 2021.

AB  - The ubiquitous connectivity of Location-Based Systems (LBS) allows people to share individual location-related data anytime. In this sense, Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN) provides valuable information to be available in large-scale and low-cost fashion via traditional data collection methods. Moreover, this data contains spatial, temporal, and social features of user activity, enabling a system to predict user mobility. In this sense, mobility prediction plays crucial roles in urban planning, traffic forecasting, advertising, and recommendations, and has thus attracted lots of attention in the past decade. In this article, we introduce the Ensemble Random Forest-Markov (ERFM) mobility prediction model, a two-layer ensemble learner approach, in which the base learners are also ensemble learning models. In the inner layer, ERFM considers the Markovian property (memoryless) to build trajectories of different lengths, and the Random Forest algorithm to predict the user’s next location for each trajectory set. In the outer layer, the outputs from the first layer are aggregated based on the classification performance of each weak learner. The experimental results on the real user trajectory dataset highlight a higher accuracy and f1-score of ERFM compared to five state-of-the-art predictors. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The increasing availability of historical floating car data (FCD) represents a relevant chance to improve the accuracy of model-based traffic forecasting systems. A more precise estimation of origin-destination (O-D) matrices is a critical issue for the successful application of traffic assignment models. The authors developed a methodology for obtaining demand matrices without any prior information, but just starting from a data set of vehicle trajectories, and without using any assignment model, as traditional correction approaches do. Several steps are considered. A data-driven approach is applied to determine both observed departure shares from origins to destinations and static assignment matrices. Then the O-D matrix estimation problem is formulated as a scaling problem of the observed FCD demand and carried out using as inputs: a set of traffic counts, the FCD revealed assignment matrix and the observed departure shares as an a-priori matrix. Four different optimisation solutions are proposed. The methodology was successfully tested on the network of Turin. The results highlight the concrete opportunity to perform a data-driven methodology that, independently from the reliability of the reference demand, minimises manual and specialised effort to build and calibrate the transportation demand models. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020

AB  - With the explosive growth in demand for mobile traffic, one of the promising solutions is to offload cellular traffic to small base stations for better system efficiency. Due to increasing system complexity, network operators are facing severe challenges and looking for machine learning-based solutions. In this work, we propose an energy-aware mobile traffic offloading scheme in the heterogeneous network jointly apply deep Q network (DQN) decision making and advanced traffic demand forecasting. The base station control model is trained and verified on an open dataset from a major telecom operator. The performance evaluation shows that DQN with traffic forecasting outperforms others at all levels of mobile traffic demands. Also, the advantage of accurate traffic prediction is more significant under higher traffic loads. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - . Modern IT and telecommunications technologies create new possibilities of data acquisition for the needs of traffic analyses and transport planning. At the same time, the current experience suggests that it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain data on interurban travels of people in a traditional way (among others, in Poland there has been no comprehensive survey of drivers on the sections of non-urban roads since 2006). Within the framework of the INMOP 3 research project, an attempt was made to analyse the use of the Big Data application possibilities including data from SIM cards of the mobile telephony operator [1] and data from probe vehicle data (also known as “floating car data”), as data sources for carrying out the traffic analyses and modelling of travels by all means of transport in Poland. The article presents the manner, in which the data were used, as well as methodological recommendations for creating transport models at the national, regional and local levels. Especially the results of work can be applied for systematic passenger cars trip matrix update. © 2021. A. Brzeziński, T. Dybicz.

AB  - An accurate call traffic forecasting can help the call center to schedule and manage its employees more scientifically. Meanwhile, to meet the needs that some tasks in the call center require the prediction of call traffic in different time buckets for a future long term, it is necessary to forecast the call traffic in a long-term and multi-step way. However, existing forecasting methods cannot solve this problem as (1) Most existing methods merely focus on short-term forecasting for the next hour or the next day. (2) The temporal features of call traffic are ignored, which leads to a lower accuracy in long-term forecasting. Hence, in this paper, we propose a holistic solution for forecasting long-term multi-step ahead call traffic. In our method, we give a categorized way for temporal features by studying the call traffic data. After data preprocessing, we develop an extraction method for temporal features extraction for training the forecasting model. We propose two forecasting strategies based on taking different types of features as input. Experimental results on the real-world call traffic dataset show the effectiveness of our solution, including data preprocessing, temporal features mining, and the forecasting model. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Energy efficiency of telecommunication networks plays an essential role in the context of sustainability and climate change - as those networks are large power-consuming distributed infrastructures. Furthermore, also an economical network operation calls for low energy demand. A challenging and crucial task for energy-ef ficient and sustainable network operation is the load-adaptive operation of network elements such as routers, switches and access multiplexers. Since the traffic is temporally fluctuating, load-adaptive control of the network requires a robust traffic demand estimation. This is also of overwhelming importance, as a stable network operation is a central task of network operators - since it is expected by their customers as the service they pay for. Here, Wiener filtering has been identified as a robust solution for reliable traffic demand forecasting on relevant time scales. The results presented in this paper show that the capacity dimensioning based on the proposed Wiener filtering traffic forecasting leads to reliable outcomes in terms of predicted traffic enabling sustainable and efficient network operation. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Telecom operators are aiming to provide high-grade data, multimedia applications and low latency videos for smart devices. As today's mobile data is experiencing rapid growth and the usage of smart devices are fabricating unparalleled challenges for telecom operators to meet the global bandwidth requirement. From the first generation to fourth generation, the technology evolution is predominantly governed by the hardware side but now it is moving towards the concept of cognitive network management, resource orchestration and machine learning-based solutions. In this paper, we propose the adaptive capacity and frequency optimization (ACFO) method for adaptive optimization based on time series forecasting approach. The daily capacity utilization of microwave (MW) links is analyzed to use forecasted demand. Based on the projected demand, the capacity and frequency optimization will be executed. The two main forecasting models 1) SARIMA and 2) MLP are used and for performance evaluation, we used RMSE and MAPE criterion. The analytic outcomes show that MLP with two layers and six hidden nodes (6/6) are good enough to achieve the desired results. In some cases, we need to exceed the hidden nodes up to fifteen (15/15). By using the forecasting approach, the reactive optimization will successfully shift to the predicted/proactive optimization, will balance the resource distribution and can condense the wastage of resources. The outcome of the study will be a contribution to the dynamic resource optimization in wireless backhaul network. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Vehicular specially appointed systems named as Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) have been raising dependent on the condition of-art advancements in remote and system communication. The message confirmations among vehicles and infrastructure are fundamental for the VANET security. The genuine personality of vehicles ought not to be uncovered, yet which is just detectable by approved nodes. Existing arrangements either depend vigorously on a carefully designed hardware or cannot fulfill the security necessity. Secured Identity Based Cryptosystem Approach (SIDBC) for intelligent routing protocol is proposed for better results since implementing a secured network for traffic forecasting and efficient routing in dynamically changing environment. Polynomial key generation is utilized for generating identity based pseudonym keys for each and every node that comes under the system. This keying process protects the node from malignant node from passing false information. The assessment output demonstrates that the planned method is more effective than past schemes since it is free pairing and it fulfills security and protection prerequisites. © 2020 SCPE.

The Dickie Fuller test and Kwiatkowski-Phillips Perron-Shin-Schmitt test were applied to determine the initial series to the class of stationary or non-stationary series. Both tests confirmed the involvement of the original series in the class of differential stationary. Based on the Dickie Fuller test and Private autocorrelation function graphs, the Integrated Moving Average Autoregression Model model is created.

AB  - In modern transportation systems, an enormous amount of traffic data is generated every day. This has led to rapid progress in short-term traffic prediction (STTP), in which deep learning methods have recently been applied. In traffic networks with complex spatiotemporal relationships, deep neural networks (DNNs) often perform well because they are capable of automatically extracting the most important features and patterns. In this study, we survey recent STTP studies applying deep networks from four perspectives. 1) We summarize input data representation methods according to the number and type of spatial and temporal dependencies involved. 2) We briefly explain a wide range of DNN techniques from the earliest networks, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines, to the most recent, including graph-based and meta-learning networks. 3) We summarize previous STTP studies in terms of the type of DNN techniques, application area, dataset and code availability, and the type of the represented spatiotemporal dependencies. 4) We compile public traffic datasets that are popular and can be used as the standard benchmarks. Finally, we suggest challenging issues and possible future research directions in STTP.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Due to the rapid growth of the number of passengers over the few recent decades, air traffic forecasting has become a crucial tool for digital transportation systems, playing a fundamental role in the planning and development of traffic management and control systems. The main goal of forecasting in air transport is to predict traffic conditions in a network, on the basis of its past behavior, in order to improve safety and reduce airspace congestion. Nevertheless, air traffic time series often present an intricate behavior because of their irregular trends and strong seasonalities. In this paper, the methodology based on time series decomposition and artificial neural networks (ANNs) is thus reviewed and reconsidered within this framework of air traffic management. In this respect, a hybrid approach coupling feedforward neural networks with a nonlinear least squares-based regression curve fitting is developed for the multistep-ahead prediction. Empirical experiments are conducted in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on passenger traffic real datasets. The results show that, despite its simplicity, the base model is capable of generating accurate forecasts, with a performance comparable with that of powerful state-of-the-art forecasting models. In addition, there is evidence that trend pretreatment (wholly or partially) would rather degrade the forecasting accuracy. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Given traffic flow measurements for one highway, how to forecast its flow in future periods? Recent works in traffic forecast propose burdensome procedures by depending on additional data that is not always available, like traffic measurements from other roads linked to the one of interest, social media, trajectory and car accident data, geographical and socio-demographic attributes, driver behavior information and weather forecast. The most accurate algorithms force anyone to monitor an entire network of highways, even when there is a single highway of interest. This procedure is commonly unaffordable. How to obtain highly accurate results without using any additional data? We answer the question with AdaptFlow: a novel, adaptive algorithm able to accurately forecast traffic flow by individually monitoring highways that are connected to each other in a complex network using local flow measurements only. We performed experiments on large datasets from highways in UK and USA. Our AdaptFlow notably outperformed well-known related works on many settings. For example, it achieved 95.5% accuracy on average when forecasting the next 15 minutes flow of the UK highways, leading to an error rate that is 36% smaller than the one of the most accurate related work that does not use additional data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The contradiction between nonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow change and real time and accuracy of traffic flow forecasting drives the study on relevant optimization algorithms. To provide intelligent traffic system with the better data and decision support, it proposes the improved wavelet neural network forecasting model of particle swarm optimization algorithm and cloud particle swarm optimization algorithm. Based on the study on short-term traffic forecasting and the theoretical exposition to wavelet neural network, this paper analyzes and summarizes such disadvantages of the wavelet neural network as slow convergence rate in the aspect of traffic flow forecasting; it improves the wavelet neural network forecasting model by utilizing the advantages of high convergence rate and strong global searching ability of the particle swarm optimization algorithm; and it gives contrastive analysis to convergence rates and forecasting error of various models by conducting simulation experiment. Finally, it is indicated by the results of simulation experiment that: the improved model of cloud particle swarm optimization algorithm possesses the highest traffic flow forecasting ability, followed by particle swarm optimization algorithm and wavelet neural network algorithm successively, which illustrates the effectiveness of modified model. The study in this paper provides the better technical support and theoretical guidance to the optimization of urban intelligent traffic management system. © 2018, Gioacchino Onorati Editore.

AB  - Accurate short-term traffic forecasts help people choose transportation and travel time. Through the query data, many models for traffic flow prediction have neglected the temporal and spatial correlation of traffic flow, so that the prediction accuracy is limited by the accuracy of traffic data. This paper proposed a short-term traffic flow prediction model that combined the spatio-temporal analysis with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). In the proposed prediction model, firstly, time correlation analysis and spatial correlation analysis were performed on the collected traffic flow data, and then the spatiotemporal feature selection algorithm was employed to define the optimal input time interval and spatial data volume. At the same time, the selected traffic flow data were extracted from the actual traffic flow data and converted into a two-dimensional matrix with spatio-temporal traffic flow information. The GRU was used to process the spatio-temporal feature information of the internal traffic flow of the matrix to achieve the purpose of prediction. Finally, the prediction results obtained by the proposed model were compared with the actual traffic flow data to verify the effectiveness of the model. The model proposed in this paper was compared with the convolutional neural network (CNN) model and the GRU model, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms both in accuracy and stability. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - To reduce the increasingly congestion in cities, it is essential for intelligent transportation system (ITS) to accurately forecast the short-term traffic flow to identify the potential congestion sites. In recent years, the emerging deep learning method has been introduced to design traffic flow predictors, such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), which has demonstrated its promising results. In this paper, different from existing work, we study the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and propose a deep learning framework based on TCN model for short-term city-wide traffic forecast to accurately capture the temporal and spatial evolution of traffic flow. Moreover, we design the model with the Taguchi method to develop an optimized structure of the TCN model, which not only reduces the number of experiments, but also yields high accuracy of forecasting results.With the real-world traffic flow data collected from highways in Birmingham City of U.K., we compare our model with four deep learning based models including LSTM models, GRU models, SAE models, DeepTrend and CNN-LSTM models in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE) regarding the actual flow data. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves the state-of-art performance with superior accuracy in short-term traffic flow forecasting. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The scalable implementation of a microscopic simulation, presented in our previous work, opens new areas of applications for traffic simulation, namely short term traffic forecasting. It can be used for real-time prediction of local, exceptional situations. Moreover it can be used as a hypothesis verification tool for evaluating different strategies of traffic control. In order to realize such simulations in a very short time (what is crucial here) a sufficient computing power is necessary what can be achieved using dedicated HPC hardware. In this paper we present methods for rapid analysis of simulation results for large urban road systems, where a local, exceptional situation can remain unnoticed. We propose new metrics for detecting and locating such situations. The detected situation can be handled automatically with the method based on the multi-variant planning approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper describes the application of a Wireless Traffic Monitoring and Tracking system in the Spanish city of Granada, as an approach for addressing important tasks in the field of Smart Traffic. To this end, several nodes of the so-called MOBYWIT system have been deployed at important urban points. They collect real-time vehicles’ movement information based on Bluetooth signals detection. The gathered data have been processed in several ways, showing some of the applications that the system has, such as the composition of Origin/Destination matrices, the computation of accurate displacement times, or the estimation of real traffic in short terms by means of Time Series Forecast. The obtained results validate the system and proves its value as a tool for the urban traffic flow monitoring, analysis and prediction, which could be used as a part of an intelligent transportation system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is critical to implement accurate short-term traffic forecasting in traffic management and control applications. This paper proposes a hybrid forecasting method based on neural networks combined with the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method for short-term traffic flow forecasting. The procedure of training a neural network model using existing traffic input-output data, i.e., training data, is indispensable for fine-tuning the prediction model. Based on this point, the K-NN method was employed to reconstruct the training data for neural network models while considering the similarity of traffic flow patterns. This was done through collecting the specific state vectors that were closest to the current state vectors from the historical database to enhance the relationship between the inputs and outputs for the neural network models. In this study, we selected four different neural network models, i.e., back-propagation (BP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network, generalized regression (GR) neural network, and Elman neural network, all of which have been widely applied for short-term traffic forecasting. Using real world traffic data, the experimental results primarily show that the BP and GR neural networks combined with the K-NN method have better prediction performance, and both are sensitive to the size of the training data. Secondly, the forecast accuracies of the RBF and Elman neural networks combined with the K-NN method both remain fairly stable with the increasing size of the training data. In summary, the proposed hybrid forecasting approach outperforms the conventional forecasting models, facilitating the implementation of short-term traffic forecasting in traffic management and control applications. © 2018, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

AB  - The technological landscape of intelligent transport systems (ITS) has been radically transformed by the emergence of the big data streams generated by the Internet of Things (IoT), smart sensors, surveillance feeds, social media, as well as growing infrastructure needs. It is timely and pertinent that ITS harness the potential of an artificial intelligence (AI) to develop the big data-driven smart traffic management solutions for effective decision-making. The existing AI techniques that function in isolation exhibit clear limitations in developing a comprehensive platform due to the dynamicity of big data streams, high-frequency unlabeled data generation from the heterogeneous data sources, and volatility of traffic conditions. In this paper, we propose an expansive smart traffic management platform (STMP) based on the unsupervised online incremental machine learning, deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning to address these limitations. The STMP integrates the heterogeneous big data streams, such as the IoT, smart sensors, and social media, to detect concept drifts, distinguish between the recurrent and non-recurrent traffic events, and impact propagation, traffic flow forecasting, commuter sentiment analysis, and optimized traffic control decisions. The platform is successfully demonstrated on 190 million records of smart sensor network traffic data generated by 545,851 commuters and corresponding social media data on the arterial road network of Victoria, Australia. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) is a kind of advanced MANET specially designed for vehicular communication. Routing in dynamic environment is difficult therefore Multi agent based cooperative routing in dynamic vehicular technology is proposed. The objective of this work is to determine effective routing by utilizing the information provided by the intelligent multi agent systems. A Co-operative Cluster based Multi-Agent Approach (CCMAA) for intelligent routing protocol is proposed for better results since implementing traffic forecasting and efficient routing in dynamically changing environment is a challenging task. The multi agent system includes mobile agent, static agent, service agent and this agent are used for optimal communication and reduces network traffic. The performance evaluation is done using the simulation tool Network Simulator (NS2) tool. Packet delivery rate, delay and throughput are the performance metrics used to evaluate the proposed protocol. © BEIESP.

AB  - The problem of predicting self-similar traffic is considered, the solution of which modeling of self-similar traffic was performed using the Simulink software package in MATLAB environment. For the simulation, the queuing system WB/M/1/K with Weibull distribution was used. The use of the spline-extrapolation method made it possible to predict self-similar traffic outside the considered period of time on which packet data transmission is considered. Extrapolation of traffic for short-term and long-term forecasts is considered. Comparison of the results of the prediction of self-similar traffic using various spline functions has shown that the accuracy of the forecast can be improved through the use of cubic splines. A method is proposed for estimating the error of traffic prediction for each variant of traffic forecasting using linear, cubic splines. The results of the research will allow you to perform effective traffic management with the support of quality characteristics, by providing the required parameters of network hardware and software in order to avoid overloads in the network. © 2019 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

AB  - An accurate short-term traffic forecasting model serves as an integral part to enhance the efficiency of vehicle rerouting and traffic light control strategies. The information exchange (pheromone) behavior of ants has been applied to forecast traffic conditions in existing pheromone models. These models were developed to forecast congestion on roads with signalized intersections by considering only green and red phases. Motivated by this issue, three short-term traffic forecasting models are proposed: (i) Extended Pheromone Model (EPM), (ii) Extended Pheromone Model with epsilon-Support Vector Regression (εSVR-EPM), and (iii) Extended Pheromone Model with Artificial Neural Network and Particle Swarm Optimization (ANNPSO-EPM). It is worth noticing that EPM is an algorithmic model whereas the other two are machine learning models. In all proposed models, a new color pheromone concept is proposed with two significant contributions. First, the color pheromone concept is developed to capture stochastic traffic conditions on the roads with non-signalized intersections. Second, the proposed concept is further extended to include all three color phases (red, yellow and green) to forecast dynamic changing traffic behaviors for roads with signalized intersections. The proposed color pheromone concept in EPM, εSVR-EPM, and ANNPSO-EPM is different from the existing models as it dynamically switches its computation techniques based on traffic light phases. All three proposed models can be realized through a Pheromone-based Multi-Agent System composed of Vehicle Agents and Intersection Agents coordinating locally with one another To promote practicality, Singapore City Hall map is employed in a microscopic simulator of Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO), showing that all proposed models outperform the other existing pheromone models. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, we developed a model re-sample Recurrent Neural Network (RRNN) to forecast passenger traffic on Mass Rapid Transit Systems (MRT). The Recurrent Neural Network was applied to build a model to perform passenger traffic prediction, where the forecast task was transformed into a classification task. However, in this process, the training dataset usually ended up being imbalanced. To address this dataset imbalance, our research proposes re-sample Recurrent Neural Network. A case study of the California Mass Rapid Transit System revealed that the model introduced in this work could timely and effectively predict passenger traffic of MRT. The measurements of passenger traffic themselves were also studied and showed that the new method provided a good understanding of the level of passenger traffic and was able to achieve prediction accuracy upwards of 90% higher than standard tests. The development of this model adds value to the methodology of traffic applications by employing these Recurrent Neural Networks. © 2019 Rong Hu et al.

AB  - One contemporary policy to deal with traffic congestion is the design and implementation of forecasting methods that allow users to plan ahead of time and decision makers to improve traffic management. Current data availability and growing computational capacities have increased the use of machine learning (ML) to address traffic prediction, which is mostly modeled as a supervised regression problem. Although some studies have presented taxonomies to sort the literature in this field, they are mostly oriented to classify the ML methods applied and a little effort has been directed to categorize the traffic forecasting problems approached by them. As far as we know, there is no comprehensive taxonomy that classifies these problems from the point of view of both traffic and ML. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy to categorize the aforementioned problems from both traffic and a supervised regression learning perspective. The taxonomy aims at unifying and consolidating categorization criteria related to traffic and it introduces new criteria to classify the problems in terms of how they are modeled from a supervised regression approach. The traffic forecasting literature, from 2000 to 2019, is categorized using this taxonomy to illustrate its descriptive power. From this categorization, different remarks are discussed regarding the current gaps and trends in the addressed traffic forecasting area. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - There is no doubt that a good knowledge of traffic demand has a direct impact on improving traffic management. Road traffic is strongly correlated with many factors such as day of week, time of day, season and holidays which make it suitable for prediction. In this paper, we develop a neural network model for hourly traffic prediction that makes full use of these temporal characteristics. The proposed algorithm is tested on a real-world case, and the experiment results is presented to evaluate its accuracy. © 2019 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Congestion analysis is essential to traffic control, especially in crowded urban road network. The recent traffic forecasting methods can provide travelers and traffic managers with early congestion warning, yet unable to reveal the relationship of congestion roads. This paper presented a congestion propagation path estimation method based on greedy algorithm to quickly extract these congestion relationships for visual analytics. The data from traffic cameras are applied to build the propagation network based on a directed weighted graph. It describes the process of congestion spreading among different segments. According to this network, congestion propagation path predicts the process of congestion spreading between different segments. In our visual design, it is applied to demonstrate the segments that will be influenced by the congested road. This is helpful for traffic managers to make effective and efficient decisions. The experimental result shows that our method achieves high accuracy thus prove the effective for the congestion propagation method. © 2018 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

AB  - 5G is expected to provide network connectivity to not only classical devices (i.e., tablets, smartphones, etc.) but also to the IoT, which will drastically increase the traffic load carried over the network. 5G will mainly rely on NFV and SDN to build flexible and on-demand instances of functional networking entities via VNFs. Indeed, 3GPP is devising a new architecture for the core network, which replaces point-to-point interfaces used in 3G and 4G by producer/consumer-based communication among 5G core network functions, facilitating deployment over a virtual infrastructure. One big advantage of using VNFs is the possibility of dynamic scaling, depending on traffic load (i.e., instantiate new resources to VNFs when the traffic load increases and reduce the number of resources when the traffic load decreases). In this article, we propose a novel mechanism to scale 5G core network resources by anticipating traffic load changes through forecasting via ML techniques. The traffic load forecast is achieved by using and training a neural network on a real dataset of traffic arrival in a mobile network. Two techniques were used and compared: RNN, more specifically LSTM; and DNN. Simulation results show that the forecast-based scalability mechanism outperforms the threshold-based solutions, in terms of latency to react to traffic change, and delay to have new resources ready to be used by the VNF to react to traffic increase. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

AB  - We propose a dynamic factor model to forecast traffic state for groups of locations. The model decomposes the grouped traffic time series into the latent common factor component and idiosyncratic component. It uses a few latent factor series to represent the comovement of the underlying dynamics of grouped traffic flows, and idiosyncratic component to represent location-specific traffic characteristics. The dynamic factor model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method via an iterative EM (expectation maximization) algorithm. The traffic state forecast for each location is a combination of the respective forecast from the common factor component and idiosyncratic component. The dynamic factor model exhibits four advantages. It provides an excellent way to (1) seamlessly incorporate spatial correlations among grouped traffic flows into forecast; (2) produce forecast simultaneously for group locations; (3) perform dimension reduction such that high-dimension grouped traffic time series can be modeled at a low-dimension space; (4) consider not only location-specific information but also global common dynamics in the forecast. Meanwhile, it also has capacity to accommodate typical characteristics of traffic flows including temporal correlation, seasonality, structural change in mean and/or covariance function, and cointegration. Forecast accuracy is significantly improved across highway network as well as urban road network in comparison with the Sparse VAR and ARIMA models. The proposed method is suitable for large-scale network traffic forecast in the context of big data environment. This research provides sufficient evidence that justified the importance and efficacy of spatial correlation for predictive accuracy and attempts to fill the gaps in literature of traffic forecast for groups of locations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper addresses priced managed lane corridors, on which travelers may choose to pay a toll to travel on the managed lanes (MLs) to realize generally faster, more reliable travel than on the adjacent, toll-free general purpose lanes (GPLs). These lanes exist in many cities across the United States and are becoming more common as transportation agencies look for innovative ways to increase capacity and regulate demand for their roadways. Commonly, demand for these lanes is modeled assuming travelers choose between the MLs and GPLs primarily based on the cost and time savings of the MLs. Although the traffic and revenue forecasts generated by these models have generally succeeded in estimating revenue, newly available empirical data from Katy Freeway and North Tarrant Express shows these models fail to capture how individual drivers make decisions. Most travelers on those freeways were not choosing—they always used the same lane regardless of travel time and toll. Travelers that used both sets of lanes often made choices that appeared counter-intuitive based on travel time savings and toll rate. This research provides a preliminary investigation into this issue, which calls into question all prior ML travel-behavior research. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.

AB  - We studied the problem of forecasting network traffic in TCP/IP networks based on statistical observational data. We determined that existing protocols (SNMP, RMON) do not provide long-term forecasting, which is necessary for network upgrades. Regression methods (AR, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA), which are the basis of protocols, use only a sequence of values of forecasted series, which makes long-term forecasting impossible. We made a conclusion that there is no universal effective method for forecasting time sequences that describe traffic of a computer network. We developed the model of a forecast of network traffic taking into account features of accumulation of statistical data: presence of a priori trajectories, a posteriori character of forecasting, finiteness of variance. We applied the apparatus of the canonical expansion of a random process, taking into account heterogeneity of traffic. We developed a mathematical apparatus to solve the problem of extrapolation of implementation; we obtained expressions for the estimation of an extrapolation error, and expressions for the reconstruction of a posteriori random process based on modeling. We took into account accuracy of a priori measurements, which makes it possible to use this model in networks with a minimum of diagnostic data. It provides accurate determination of parameters of a random process at control points and the minimum standard approximation error in the intervals between these points. Application of the proposed method based on the canonical decomposition of random processes provides a solution to the problem of long-term forecasting of network traffic. A comparative analysis of forecasting methods indicates that the method of canonical decomposition of a random process comes close to intelligent forecasting methods. © 2018 Vitalii Savchenko, Oleksander Matsko, Oleh Vorobiov, Yaroslav Kizyak, Larysa Kriuchkova, Yurii Tikhonov, Andrei Kotenko.

AB  - This article identifies the unavoidably required upgrade of short-term realizable elastic optical networks (EONs) operating over single-mode fibers toward spectrally-spatially flexible optical networks (SS-FONs), exploiting spatial division multiplexing (SDM) technology in order to cope with the expected mid-and long-term future traffic forecasts. Since a complete EON to SS-FON network migration overnight is unrealistic, this article proposes a gradual greenfield migration strategy employing novel heuristic planning solutions. These solutions allow identifying which network components should be SDM-capable so as to support the forecasted traffic increase at a given time. To allow transmission in an SS-FON, links should be extended with SDM-capable fibers and nodes should be equipped with SDM-capable reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers. Using the proposed solutions, a migration case study in a national reference core network is provided and analyzed. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposed a data driven, machine learning traffic modelling approach for estimating required bandwidth during telecommunication planning for good quality service delivery. The multilayer perceptron was employed to estimate the offered traffic, a safety factor was incorporated to ensure smooth flow of traffic and a neutralisation factor for moderating under or over provisioning of the bandwidth resource. The offered traffic input lags were varied from 1 to 24. The training epoch values of 200, 500, and 1000 on one and two hidden layered networks were used. The learning algorithm was backpropagation with 0.1 learning rate and 0.9 momentum on logistic sigmoid activation function. The scheme was implemented in Visual Basic and compared with four existing statistically based bandwidth estimation formulae, using four categories of classified traffic of a residential network of a firm in Nigeria. The findings revealed that the proposed scheme gave the minimum cost function, loss rate, and the highest average utilisation on two of the traffic categories (the HOURLYJN and of HOURLY_OUT), outperformed two of the existing models on the DAILYJN traffic category and one of the existing models on the DAILY_OUT traffic set. The study recommended that the proposed scheme would serve more effectively toward enhancing internet management related tasks such as general resource capacity planning. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

AB  - With the rapid growth of satellite traffic, the ability to forecast traffic loads becomes vital for improving data transmission efficiency and resource management in satellite networks. To precisely forecast the short-term traffic loads in satellite networks, a forecasting algorithm based on principal component analysis and a generalized regression neural network (PCA-GRNN) is proposed. The PCA-GRNN algorithm exploits the hidden regularity of satellite networks and fully considers both the temporal and spatial correlations of satellite traffic. Specifically, it selects optimal time series of spatio-temporally correlated historical traffic from satellites as forecasting inputs and applies principal component analysis to reduce the input dimensions while preserving the main features of the data. Then, a generalized regression neural network is utilized to perform the final short-term load forecasting based on the obtained principal components. The PCA-GRNN algorithm is evaluated based on real-world traffic traces, and the results show that the PCA-GRNN method achieves a higher forecasting accuracy, has a shorter training time and is more robust than other state-of-the-art algorithms, even for incomplete traffic datasets. Therefore, the PCA-GRNN algorithm can be regarded as a preferred solution for use in real-time traffic forecasting for realistic satellite networks.

AB  - Information technologies and applied mathematics provide us with a comprehensive framework to search for solutions to problems derived from traffic management.It is relevant for the mobility in our future cities to integrate the Full Electric Vehicle (FEV) in an interoperability network which allows us to track the FEV autonomy and to forecast the traffic and the power supply demand in the city. The target is to optimize the energy consumption and to improve the mobility in the city. To achieve these goals we propose an infrastructure to efficiently manage the power supply availability in the network of charge stations in the city and an adaptive model to predict the traffic based on historic data and on time series obtained mathematically. © 2019

AB  - With the development of wireless devices and the increase of mobile users, the operator’s focus has shifted from the construction of the communication network to the operation and maintenance of the network. Operators are eager to know the behavior of mobile networks and the real-time experience of users, which requires the using of historical data to accurately predict future network conditions. Big data analysis and computing which is widely adopted can be used as a solution. However, there are still some challenges in data analysis and prediction for mobile network optimization, such as the timeliness and accuracy of the prediction. This paper proposes a traffic analysis and prediction system which is suitable for urban wireless communication networks by combining actual call detail record (CDR) data analysis and multivariate prediction algorithms. Firstly, a spatial-temporal modeling is used for historical traffic data extracting. After that, causality analysis is applied to communication data analysis for the first time. Based on causal analysis, multivariate long short-term memory models are used to predict future data for CDR data. Finally, the prediction algorithm is used to process real data of different scenes in the city to verify the performance of the entire system. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Network traffic forecasts, as it is well known, can be useful for network resource optimization. In order to minimize the forecast error by maximizing information utilization with low complexity, this paper concerns the difference of traffic trends at large time scales and fits a dual-related model to predict it. First, by analyzing traffic trends based on user behavior, we find both hour-to-hour and day-to-day patterns, which means that models based on either of the single trends are unable to offer precise predictions. Then, a prediction method with the consideration of both daily and hourly traffic patterns, called the dual-related forecasting method, is proposed. Finally, the correlation for traffic data is analyzed based on model parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed model is more effective in reducing forecasting error than other models.

AB  - Ex-post evaluations of benefit-cost analyses (BCAs) of transportation projects are scarce in the literature. If conducted frequently, they could reveal the extent to which objectives are achieved and may give inputs that can improve the quality of ex-ante BCAs. We first explain the usefulness of ex-post BCA evaluations of transportation projects, depending on which planning phase a project is in. We then perform ex-post BCAs on 27 Norwegian road projects that have been in service for at least 5 years and compare the results with the ex-ante BCAs that were presented to the decision-makers. We use two different measures of aggregating the magnitudes of accuracy; the Mean Percentage Error (MPE) and Mean Absolute Percentage (MAPE). Using MPE, we find that: (1) ex-ante BCAs underestimate the actual net present value (NPV) by 50% on average and, the NPV per dollar invested by a mere 0.14% points on average; (2) the traffic level and traffic growth rates are often underestimated ex-ante, leading to an underestimation of the benefits and; (3) construction costs are underestimated by 5% on average, which is too small to offset the observed underestimation of benefits. By default, MAPE shows higher values of inaccuracies implying that one should not be indifferent as to the measure used. Overall, the Norwegian ex-ante BCAs perform fairly well. We urge that the authorities concerned must improve their traffic forecasts and construction cost estimates to assure that the ex-ante objectives are met. The upkeep of ex-ante data is essential to enable ex-post evaluation which, ceteris paribus, will enhance the transparency and credibility of BCA as an appropriate decision-making tool. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The road network development programme, as well as planning and design of transport systems of cities and agglomerations require complex analyses and traffic forecasts. It particularly applies to higher-class roads (motorways and expressways), which in urban areas, support different types of traffic. Usually there is a conflict between the needs of long-distance traffic, in the interest of which higher-class roads run through undeveloped areas, and the needs of bringing such road closer to potential destinations, cities [1]. By recognising the importance of this problem it is necessary to develop the research and methodology of traffic analysis, especially trip models. The current experience shows that agglomeration models are usually simplified in comparison to large city models, what results from misunderstanding of the significance of these movements for the entire model functioning, or the lack of input data. The article presents the INMOP 3 research project results, within the framework of which it was attempted to increase the accuracy of traffic generation in agglomeration model owing to the use of BigData - the mobile operator's data on SIM card movements in the Warsaw agglomeration. © 2019 A.

AB  - An input vector composed of various features plays an important role in short-Term traffic forecasting. However, there is limited research on the optimal feature selection of an input vector for a certain forecasting task. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a cohesion-based heuristic feature selection method by analyzing the nature of the forecasting methods. This method is able to determine which features should be contained in an input vector to make a forecasting algorithm perform better. The proposed method is demonstrated in two experiments based on the empirical traffic flow data. The results show that the method is able to improve the performances of the short-Term traffic forecasting algorithms. It is then suggested to consider the proposed method as a preprocessing procedure in practical forecasting applications. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - As a crucial part of the Intelligent Transportation System, traffic forecasting is of great help for traffic management and guidance. However, predicting short-term traffic conditions on a large-scale road network is challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies found in traffic data. Previous studies used Euclidean proximity or topological adjacency to explore the spatial correlation of traffic flows, but did not consider the higher-order connectivity patterns exhibited in a road network, which have a significant influence on traffic propagation. Meanwhile, traffic sequences display distinct multiple time-frequency properties, yet few researchers have made full use of this resource. To fill this gap, we propose a novel hybrid framework - Wavelet-based Higher-order Spatial-Temporal method (Wavelet-HST) to accurately predict network-scale traffic speeds. Wavelet-HST first uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose raw traffic data into several components with different frequency sub-bands. Then a motif-based graph convolutional recurrent neural network (Motif-GCRNN) is proposed to learn the higher-order spatio-temporal dependencies of traffic speeds from low-frequency components, and auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models are employed to simulate random fluctuations from the high-frequency components. We evaluate the framework on a traffic dataset collected in Chengdu, China, and experimental results demonstrate that Wavelet-HST outperforms six state-of-art prediction methods by an improvement of 7.8% ~10.5% in the root mean square error.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Short-term travel time prediction is an essential input to intelligent transportation systems. Timely and accurate traffic forecasting is necessary for advanced traffic management systems and advanced traveler information systems. Despite several short-term travel time prediction approaches have been proposed in the past decade, especially for hybrid models that consist of machine learning models and statistical models, few studies focus on the over-fitting problem brought by hybrid models. The over-fitting problem deteriorates the prediction accuracy especially during peak hours. This paper proposes a hybrid model that embraces wavelet neural network (WNN), Markov chain (MAR), and the volatility (VOA) model for short-term travel time prediction in a freeway system. The purpose of this paper is to provide deeper insights into underlining dynamic traffic patterns and to improve the prediction accuracy and robustness. The method takes periodical analysis, error correction, and noise extraction into consideration and improve the forecasting performance in peak hours. The proposed methodology predicts travel time by decomposing travel time data into three components: a periodic trend presented by a modified WNN, a residual part modeled by Markov chain, and the volatility part estimated by the modified generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model. Forecasting performance is investigated with freeway travel time data from Houston, Texas and examined by three measures: mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error. The results show that the travel times predicted by the WNN-MAR-VOA method are robust and accurate. Meanwhile, the proposed method is able to capture the underlying periodic characteristics and volatility nature of travel time data. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Maritime traffic prediction is critical for ocean transportation safety management. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge assisted methodology for maritime traffic forecasting based on a vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior. The vessel's waterway pattern is extracted through a proposed lattice-based DBSCAN algorithm that significantly reduces the problem scale, and its motion behavior is quantitatively modeled for the first time using kernel density estimation. The proposed methodology facilitates the knowledge extraction, storage, and retrieval, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support maritime traffic forecasting. By incorporating both the vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior knowledge, our solution suggests a set of probable coordinates with the corresponding probability as the forecasting output. The proposed forecasting algorithm is capable of accurately predicting maritime traffic 5, 30, and 60 min ahead, while its computation can be efficiently completed in milliseconds for single vessel prediction. Owing to such a high computational efficiency, an extensive predictive analysis of hundreds of vessels has been reported for the first time in this paper. A web-based prototype platform is implemented for Singapore waters to demonstrate the solution's feasibility in a real-world maritime operation system. The proposed approaches can be generalized for other marine waters around the world. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a novel mobility monitoring system and some of its applications to address problems that would be solved in a Smart City, such as the optimization of traffic flows in terms of trip-time and security (Smart Traffic), and the improvement of security or energetic issues inside buildings. The system tracks the movement of people and vehicles monitoring the radioelectric space, catching the WiFi and Bluetooth signals emitted by personal (smartphones) or on-board (hands-free) devices. A study has been conducted in four different real scenarios, i.e. with real data gathered by the system: two related with people's mobility (a public building and a discotheque); and two focused in traffic tracking (urban and intercity roads). The analysis has consisted on the application of different data mining techniques to extract useful knowledge, traffic forecasting methods to perform accurate predictions, and statistical analyses to model and validate the system reliability (comparing to other real data sources). The obtained results show the viability and utility of the system in all the cases, along with some of its multiple applications for solving different issues in a city. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - South-East Asia is considered one of the fastest air traffic growing regions in the world. Congested air traffic and weather conditions have thus become major factors in air traffic management. In this paper the model for air traffic forecasting was able to forecast the country, city-pair and airport-pair air traffic. Results show that the passenger forecasting for Singapore has dependence not only on that country but on neighbouring countries as well. The paper predicts that the passenger movements in Changi airport will increase up to 81.65 million people by year 2023, which is 31.23 % more than that in 2017. Also, the number of passenger aircraft between Singapore and Jakarta city-pair will increase up to 34702 by year 2023, which is 26.6 % more than that in 2017. In addition, the number of passenger aircraft between Changi airport and KLIA airport-pair will be between 31698 and 40311 by year 2023. © 2019 International Academic Press.

AB  - This study assesses the accuracy of toll road traffic forecasts in Norway. This study contributes to extant literature regarding transportation economics and policy because few studies have analyzed the accuracy of toll road traffic forecasts and current studies on this topic do not use a succinct econometric framework to infer the forecast's bias and efficiency, which are determinants of the accuracy of forecasts. The data for this study include 68 toll road projects where forecasts and actual out-turns were available. All projects that are included in this study were opened for traffic during 1975–2014. Transport models were made mandatory for forecasting toll traffic in 2006. The results of this study reveal the following: (i) Norwegian toll road traffic forecasts are underestimated but are close to accurate because the mean percentage error is a mere 4%. This result sharply contrasts international studies that resulted in large overestimations at more than −20%. (ii) The accuracy of forecasts has not improved since transport models became mandatory. (iii) The Norwegian toll road traffic forecasts are unbiased, which implies that they do not tend to be one-sided. (iv) Norwegian forecasts are efficient, which implies that available information is used adequately when making forecasts. Our conclusion is that the toll traffic forecasts in Norway perform fairly well compared to the forecasts of other countries. In addition, we recommend that the assessment of forecasts in the transportation sector should be based on succinct econometric frameworks; otherwise, the conclusions may lack important information regarding the bias and efficiency of the forecasts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Short-term prediction of traffic conditions on urban arterials has recently become increasingly important because of its vital role in the basic traffic management functions and trip decision-making processes. Such information is useful for optimal infrastructure operation, routing, and trip scheduling. However, forecasting models offering a high accuracy at a fine temporal resolution (e.g., 1 or 5 min) and, especially, lane-based are still rare and need special attention. Given the dynamic and stochastic nature of traffic, this study proposes a genetically optimized artificial neural network (GA-ANN) and locally weighted regression (GA-LWR) multivariate models, for short-term traffic prediction using a combination of multiple traffic variables such as volume, occupancy, and speed, during peak and off-peak periods. The proposed 5-min GA-ANN and GA-LWR disaggregate multivariate models show lower average and 95th percentile (P95) errors, when compared to those reported in the literature. In particular, for peak and off-peak time prediction, the GA-ANN disaggregate multivariate models result in most of the average errors being from 2% to 5% and the 95th percentile errors being from 9% to 10%. On the other hand, for peak and off-peak time traffic prediction, the GA-LWR disaggregate multivariate models show that most of the average errors are lower than 5% and the 95th percentile errors are lower than 10%. Meanwhile, for peak and off-peak time prediction, both GA-ANN and GA-LWR disaggregates models show lower MSE of 0.11–1.84. Hence, such techniques are believed useful for developing a robust urban traffic forecasting system. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Highway projects are the favorites of public-private partnership (PPP) investors because of their stable cash flow. However, there are high uncertainties in terms of traffic volume, resulting in unpredictable revenues, which has drawn major concern of PPP investors. For a road in a network, the traffic volume is determined by the traffic allocation rate, which is affected not only by the total traffic volume in the region but also by other traffic risk factors, such as travel time, toll rates, and travelling comfort. The conventional traffic allocation forecasting technique predominantly depends on the travel time, overlooking other risk factors. Consequently, traffic allocation forecasting is usually inaccurate. To improve the accuracy of traffic allocation forecasting in PPP road projects, this paper proposes to consider the effect of traffic risks together with traffic time by using the mean utility. Multinomial logit (MNL) model based on mean utility is used to predict the traffic allocation rate. To validate the proposed model, the system dynamic (SD) modeling is established to forecast the traffic volume of a case highway using the proposed traffic allocation forecasting model. The simulated result shows that the simulated traffic volume of past years from the proposed model is highly consistent with the actual one, evidencing that the proposed model can greatly improve the accuracy of the traffic forecasting. © 2018 Jie Li et al.

AB  - Design-hour volume (DHV) and directional DHV (DDHV) are important traffic forecast parameters for both planning and operational studies. They are used for roads and intersection design and operational analysis. Estimating these two parameters requires a record of hourly volumes for every hour in a year. Therefore, permanent traffic counters are usually used to keep a record of those hourly volumes. The use of permanent counters faces several challenges because of adjacent construction activities and hardware or communication failure. These challenges result in the missing part of the collected data. Moreover, estimating DHV and DDHV based on short-term traffic counts is often needed. In this research, an artificial intelligence approach is used to estimate DHV and DDHV for roadways with different functional classifications. An artificial neural network model, which utilises historical records of annual average daily traffic along with other road characteristics, such as number of lanes and functional classification, is developed. Results show that the model was able to achieve a highly accurate and reliable DHV and DDHV estimates. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In this work time series forecasting models and techniques are implemented to video traffic as part of three dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes. Traffic produced by videos is known to exhibit characteristics such as long and short range dependencies but as it is shown here non-linearity and conditional volatility may also appear as potential characteristics and then affect the choice of forecasting techniques. While models such as FARIMA, ARIMA and Holt-Winters have been used as traffic predictors in bandwidth allocation schemes, we attempt to improve the accuracy of video traffic predictions by using FARIMA/GARCH, hybrid FARIMA or FARIMA/GARCH with neural networks, a model selection strategy based on a non-linearity test, and a forecasting strategy which combines the forecasts produced by a FARIMA, a FARIMA/GARCH and a neural network. The traffic forecasts are used to allocate bandwidth following three different dynamic schemes. The performance of the different forecasting approaches is then tested on eight traces, aggregated on different timescales (frames, GoPs or seconds); and their comparison pertains their predictive capacity but mainly their cost effectiveness when contributing to dynamic bandwidth allocation approaches. Lastly, using the best forecasting approach, which on the average appears to be the hybrid FARIMA/GARCH-MLP model it is possible to evaluate the allocation schemes based on buffering and utilization rate, average and maximum queue length and total number of changes of allocated bandwidth. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Directing against the shortcoming of low accuracy in short-term traffic flow prediction caused by strong traffic flow fluctuation, a novel method for short-term traffic forecasting based on the combination of improved grey Verhulst prediction algorithm and first-order difference exponential smoothing is proposed. Firstly, we constructed an improved grey Verhulst prediction model by introducing the Markov chain to its traditional version. Then, based on an introduced dynamic weighting factor, the improved grey Verhulst prediction method, and the first-order difference exponential smoothing technique, the new method for short-term traffic forecasting is completed in an efficient way. Finally, experiment and analysis are carried out in the light of actual data gathered from strong fluctuation environment to verify the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed scheme.  © 2018 Darong Huang et al.

AB  - Intersection turning movements' counts are critical input data for traffic studies, analysis, and forecasting. These types of counts are often used to analyze operational performance of signalized intersections under different traffic conditions and peak hours. There are several methods to collect these movements, such as manual counts and video image processing. Traffic studies require turning movement counts although they may not be readily available, especially in the case of traffic forecasting or when seasonal adjustment factors are applied. In these cases, only approach volumes might be available and turning movements are assumed using different techniques to balance the inbound and outbound traffic. Nonetheless, these techniques require initial conditions, and their outcomes are highly sensitive to the initial assumptions. In this paper, a robust and practical method is developed. The turning movement counts at 691 four-leg, and 156 three-leg signalized intersections are analyzed to develop an accurate and reliable turning movement estimation model. A total of 4,175 hours of turning movement counts are used. An artificial neural networks (ANN) model is trained to analyze the relationship between the approach volumes and the corresponding turning movements. The results show that the developed ANN model can be utilized to predict turning movements at a high level of accuracy. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate traffic flow prediction under abnormal conditions, such as accidents, adverse weather, work zones, and holidays, is significant for proactive traffic control. Here, the authors focus on a special challenge of how to develop robust responsive algorithms and prediction models for short-term traffic forecasting in different traffic conditions. To this end, this study presents an ensemble learning algorithm for the short-term traffic flow prediction via the integration of gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Four different model structures whether considering the feature selection are proposed and tested for multi-step-ahead prediction under both normal and abnormal conditions. The results indicate that the proposed multi-model ensemble models are superior to the benchmark algorithms, i.e., support vector regression, and random forests, the GBRT model outperforms the Lasso model under normal traffic conditions, and the Lasso model has a better prediction accuracy under abnormal traffic conditions. In addition, the Lasso model with the feature selection is superior to the full feature model under either normal or abnormal conditions, while the GBRT model is not always better under normal conditions. The proposed integration framework is general and flexible to assemble various traffic prediction algorithms. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to forecast the traffic flow more precisely, a novel hybrid model is proposed with multiple sources of traffic data in the spatiotemporal dimension. In the practical application of the proposed model, multiple sources of data are captured and fused from five toll collection gates and one remote microwave sensor based on the correlation analysis. A hybrid model, including the structure of stacked autoencoders and long short-Term memory, is used. Stacked autoencoders are used to extract the spatial features. Long short-Term memory is used to learn the temporal features. The comparisons of the hybrid model, non-hybrid model, fused data, and non-fused data are provided. The effectiveness of the hybrid model and the fused data demonstrated the best performance. The fused data presented more effective forecast, which encourages that the forecasting model could include more data source to improve the accuracy. Meanwhile, the selection of a suitable model should also be studied for better forecasting result in consideration of difference feature of the data source. The high-Accuracy prediction could contribute to further traffic control and prompt the development of the intelligent transport system. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Multistep traffic forecasting on road networks is a crucial task in successful intelligent transportation system applications. To capture the complex non-stationary temporal dynamics and spatial correlations in multistep traffic-condition prediction, we propose a novel deep learning framework named attention graph convolutional sequence-to-sequence model (AGC-Seq2Seq). In the proposed deep learning framework, spatial and temporal dependencies are modeled through the Seq2Seq model and graph convolution network separately, and the attention mechanism along with a newly designed training method based on the Seq2Seq architecture is proposed to overcome the difficulty in multistep prediction and further capture the temporal heterogeneity of traffic pattern. We conduct numerical tests to compare AGC-Seq2Seq with other benchmark models using two real-world datasets. The results indicate that our model yields the best prediction performance in terms of various prediction error measures. Furthermore, the variations of spatio-temporal correlations of traffic conditions under different perdition steps and road segments are revealed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Knowing daily traffic for the current year is recognized as being essential in many fields of transport analysis and practice, and short-term forecasting models offer a set of tools to meet these needs. This paper examines and compares the accuracy of three representative parametric and non-parametric prediction models, selected by the analysis of the numerous methods proposed in the literature for their good combination of forecast accuracy and ease of calibration, using real-life data on Italian motorway stretches. Non-parametric K-NN regression model, Gaussian maximum likelihood model and double seasonality Holt–Winters exponential smoothing model confirm their goodness to predict the weekly and monthly fluctuations of average daily traffic with varying degrees of performance, while maintaining an easy use in professional practice, i.e. requiring ordinary professional skills and conventional analysis tools. Since combining several prediction models can give, on average, more accuracy than that of the individual models, the paper compares two weighting methods of easy implementation and susceptible to a direct use, namely the widely used information entropy method and the less widespread Shapley value method. Despite being less common than the information entropy method, the Shapley value method proves to be more capable in better combining single forecasts and produces improvements in the predictions for test data. With these remarks, the paper might be of interest to traffic technicians or analysts, in various and not uncommon tasks they might find in their work. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Autonomous vehicles are soon to become ubiquitous in large urban areas, encompassing cities, suburbs and vast highway networks. In turn, this will bring new challenges to the existing traffic management expert systems. Concurrently, urban development is causing growth, thus changing the network structures. As such, a new generation of adaptive algorithms are needed, ones that learn in real-time, capture the multivariate nonlinear spatio-temporal dependencies and are easily adaptable to new data (e.g. weather or crowdsourced data) and changes in network structure, without having to retrain and/or redeploy the entire system. We propose learning Topology-Regularized Universal Vector Autoregression (TRU-VAR) and examplify deployment with of state-of-the-art function approximators. Our expert system produces reliable forecasts in large urban areas and is best described as scalable, versatile and accurate. By introducing constraints via a topology-designed adjacency matrix (TDAM), we simultaneously reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy by capturing the non-linear spatio-temporal dependencies between timeseries. The strength of our method also resides in its redundancy through modularity and adaptability via the TDAM, which can be altered even while the system is deployed. The large-scale network-wide empirical evaluations on two qualitatively and quantitatively different datasets show that our method scales well and can be trained efficiently with low generalization error. We also provide a broad review of the literature and illustrate the complex dependencies at intersections and discuss the issues of data broadcasted by road network sensors. The lowest prediction error was observed for TRU-VAR, which outperforms ARIMA in all cases and the equivalent univariate predictors in almost all cases for both datasets. We conclude that forecasting accuracy is heavily influenced by the TDAM, which should be tailored specifically for each dataset and network type. Further improvements are possible based on including additional data in the model, such as readings from different metrics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is a necessary part in the intelligent transportation systems in supporting dynamic and proactive traffic control and making traffic management plan. However, most of the previous studies attempting to build traffic flow forecasting models focus on short-term forecasting as the next step. In this paper, a deep feature leaning approach is proposed to predict short-term traffic flow in the following multiple steps using supervised learning techniques. To achieve traffic flow forecasting for the next day, an advanced multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to optimize some parameters in deep belief networks. The modified model can boost the accuracy of the forecasting results and enhance its multiple step prediction ability. Using real-time and historical temporal–spatial traffic data, day-ahead prediction experiment is implemented. The results of the hybrid model are compared with several commonly used benchmark models and some improved deep neural network based on evaluation criteria. Also, the proposed optimization algorithm is compared with the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the significance in the number of hidden layers is analyzed. When the layers are increasing more than 4, the performance of the proposed model stops improving significantly. The results indicate the proposed model can extract complex features of traffic flow and therefore the forecasting accuracy and stability can be effectively improved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traffic flow prediction is essential in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Due to the complexity of the traffic environment, predicting future traffic speed is difficult. A lot of methods have been proposed to forecast traffic flow, such as support vector regression (SVR), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and so on. However, there are few ensemble models methods for predicting traffic flow, especially for predicting multi-step traffic speed. Meanwhile, these ensemble methods often use many base models for regression. Thus, the performances of these existing methods are worth exploring for multi-step traffic forecasts with few base models. Besides, this paper proposes a model based on ensemble models, called 'Triplet Decoders Neural Network' (TDNN), to compare with these methods. By analyzing the characteristic of traffic speed data, this paper also proposes a data preprocessing model called 'T-Conversion' to help RNN capturing long-Term dependencies. Our experiments are implemented based on real traffic speed data from Baidu in Beijing, China because the prediction for complex traffic is more valuable. With these new novel ideas, our experiments show the superior performances of TDNN, and the significant effect of T-Conversion for predicting traffic speed sequences. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Telecommunication traffic prediction is an important aspect of data analysis and processing in communication networks. In this study, we utilize the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) prediction method to improve the prediction performance of telecommunication traffic. As the parameters of LSSVM are difficult to determine, we propose to optimize the LSSVM parameters using the improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm based on the fitness-prediction strategy (i.e. FP-IABC). We employ real traffic data collected on site to establish a telecommunication traffic forecasting model based on FP-IABC optimizing LSSVM (FP-IABC-LSSVM). The experiment results indicate that in the case involving no increase in the computational complexity, the proposed telecommunication traffic forecasting model-based FP-IABC-LSSVM has a higher prediction accuracy than the prediction model based on the ABC optimizing LSSVM (ABC-LSSVM), particle swarm optimizing LSSVM (PSO-LSSVM), and genetic algorithm optimizing LSSVM (GA-LSSVM). Further, with respect to the standard root mean square error and the average computation time, the proposed FP-IABC-LSSVM is the optimal prediction method of all of the comparison methods. The proposed prediction method not only improves the prediction accuracy, but also reduces the average computation time. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Aiming at the problems that current predicting models are incapable of extracting the inner rule of the traffic flow sequence in traffic big data, and unable to make full use of the spatio-temporal relationship of the traffic flow to improve the accuracy of prediction, a Bi-directional Regression Neural Network (BRNN) is proposed in this paper, which can fully apply the context information of road intersections both in the past and the future to predict the traffic volume, and further to make up the deficiency that the current models can only predict the next-moment output according to the time series information in the previous moment. Meanwhile, a vectorized code to screen out the intersections related to the predicting point in the road network and to train and predict through inputting the track data of the selected intersections into BRNN, is designed. In addition, the model is testified through the true traffic data in partial area of Shen Zhen. The results indicate that, compared with current traffic predicting models, the model in this paper is capable of providing the necessary evidence for traffic guidance and control due to its excellent performance in extracting the spatio-temporal feature of the traffic flow series, which can enhance the accuracy by 16.298% on average. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The application of short-term traffic forecasting can guide the operation of traffic networks efficiently and reduce the traffic cost for travelers. On the basis of radial basis function (RBF) neural network, this paper introduces a tunable and transferable RBF (TT-RBF) model to conduct on-line forecasting and transfer forecasting. Considering the spatiotemporal correlation of traffic flows in a road network, a spatiotemporal state matrix formed by the detrended cross-correlation analysis is used for the model input. With the on-line forecasting process, an improved on-line structure and parameter adjustment are proposed to enhance the existing model. Thus, the TT-RBF model can be adaptive to time-varying traffic states, especially to deal with the difference between non-peak and peak hours. Moreover, the proposed model can be transferred from one road segment to act on other road segments. By this way, the traffic states of numerous road segments can be forecasted conveniently without complex model training processes. The floating car data of a typical road network in Beijing are used for the performance verification of the TT-RBF model, and some frequently used forecasting models are selected for comparisons. The numerical experiments show that the TT-RBF model can get more accurate results than those in single-step forecasting, multi-step forecasting, and transfer forecasting. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Timely predicting and controlling the traffic congestion in a station caused by an emergency is an important task in railway emergency management. However, traffic forecasting in an emergency is subject to a dynamic service network, with uncertainty surrounding elements such as the capacity of the transport network, schedules, and plans. Accurate traffic forecasting is difficult. This paper proposes a practical time-space network model based on a train diagram for predicting and controlling the traffic congestion in a station caused by an emergency. Based on the train diagram, we constructed a symmetric time-space network for the first time by considering the transition of the railcar state. On this basis, an improved A* algorithm based on the railcar flow route was proposed to generate feasible path sets and a dynamic railcar flow distribution model was built to simulate the railcar flow distribution process in an emergency. In our numerical studies, these output results of our proposed model can be used to control traffic congestion. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The concept of big Data for intelligent transportation system has been employed for traffic management on dealing with dynamic traffic environments. Big data analytics helps to cope with large amount of storage and computing resources required to use mass traffic data effectively. However these traditional solutions brings us unprecedented opportunities to manage transportation data but it is inefficient for building the next-generation intelligent transportation systems as Traffic data exploring in velocity and volume on various characteristics. In this article, a new deep intelligent prediction network has been introduced that is hierarchical and operates with spatiotemporal characteristics and location based service on utilizing the Sensor and GPS data of the vehicle in the real time. The proposed model employs deep learning architecture to predict potential road clusters for passengers. It is injected as recommendation system to passenger in terms of mobile apps and hardware equipment employment on the vehicle incorporating location based services models to seek available parking slots, traffic free roads and shortest path for reach destination and other services in the specified path etc. The underlying the traffic data is classified into clusters with extracting set of features on it. The deep behavioural network processes the traffic data in terms of spatiotemporal characteristics to generate the traffic forecasting information, vehicle detection, autonomous driving and driving behaviours. In addition, markov model is embedded to discover the hidden features .The experimental results demonstrates that proposed approaches achieves better results against state of art approaches on the performance measures named as precision, execution time, feasibility and efficiency. © BEIESP.

AB  - As an important part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS), short-term traffic prediction has become a hot research topic in the field of traffic engineering. In recent years, with the emergence of rich traffic data and the development of deep learning technologies, neural networks have been widely used in short-term traffic forecasting. Among them, the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), especially the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) shows the excellent ability of time-series tasks. To improve the prediction accuracy of the LSTM, some research uses the spatial–temporal matrix or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the spatial features of the data for the LSTM network to use. In this article, we propose an attention CNN to predict traffic speed. The model uses three-dimensional data matrices constructed by traffic flow, speed, and occupancy. The spatial–temporal features extraction and the attention models are all performed by the convolution unit. Experiments on traffic data at 15-minute intervals show that the proposed algorithm has considerable advantages in predicting tasks compared to other commonly used algorithms, and the proposed algorithm has an improvement effect for cases with missing data. At the same time, by visualizing the weights generated by the attention model, we can see the influence of different spatial–temporal data on the forecasting task. © 2018 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering

AB  - The concept of traffic congestion and traffic management is ambiguous in nature. The traffic and congestion is dependent on a number of factors that might impact the stretch of road or the framework of the traffic management systems. As the evolution of internet in last one decade and its reach to the very last person on this planet, this provides the basket of new opportunity of managing the traffic and its patterns on the basis of live traffic data from the onsite cameras, sensors, and the google maps traffic forecast the situation of traffic congestion would be avoided, which directly helps in reducing the load on environment and saving some valuable time of the commuters, and indirectly having large savings on the countries resources. In this research paper the authors have identified the factors affecting the management, flow, and working of traffic on the toll roads, national highways, and dedicated fright corridors in specific from the literature. The identified factors have been analyzed using quantitative statistical tools such as: relative importance index, Cronbach’s alpha, and cluster analysis to know the predictor importance. For this study a total of 192 valid responses were received using structured questionnaire survey. On the basis of data analysis the recommendation have be drawn and shared with the government authorities to be implemented on the highways to facilitate the commuters and all the other stakeholders associated with the traffic and traffic management. The findings of the relative importance index conclude that the most significant attributes of traffic management are No tolling for e-vehicles, use of information boards to avoid any traffic situations, and savings on fuels. Furthermore the findings of the cluster analysis concludes that the most important predictor is no-tolling for e-vehicles, followed by savings on fuels. © BEIESP.

AB  - —The use of base station (BS) sleep modes is one of the most studied approaches for the reduction of the energy consumption of radio access networks (RANs). Many papers have shown that the potential energy saving of sleep modes is huge, provided the future behavior of the RAN traffic load is known. This paper investigates the effectiveness of sleep modes combined with machine learning (ML) approaches for traffic forecast. A portion of an RAN is considered, comprising one macro BS and a few small cell BSs. Each BS is powered by a photovoltaic (PV) panel, equipped with energy storage units, and a connection to the power grid. The PV panel and battery provide green energy, while the power grid provides brown energy. This paper examines the impacts of different prediction models on the consumed energy mix and on QoS. Numerical results show that the considered ML algorithms succeed in achieving effective trade-offs between energy consumption and QoS. Results also show that energy savings strongly depend on traffic patterns that are typical of the considered area. This implies that a widespread implementation of these energy saving strategies without the support of ML would require a careful tuning that cannot be performed autonomously and that needs continuous updates to follow traffic pattern variations. On the contrary, ML approaches provide a versatile framework for the implementation of the desired tradeoff that naturally adapts the network operation to the traffic characteristics typical of each area and to its evolution. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic speed prediction, as one of the most important topics in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), has been investigated thoroughly in the literature. Nonetheless, traditional methods show their limitation in coping with complexity and high nonlinearity of traffic data as well as learning spatial-temporal dependencies. Particularly, they often neglect the dynamics happening to traffic network. Attention-based models witnessed extensive developments in recent years and have shown its efficacy in a host of fields, which inspires us to leverage graph-attention-based method to handling traffic network speed prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Networks (ST-GAT). A graph attention mechanism is adopted to extract the spatial dependencies among road segments. Additionally, we introduce a LSTM network to extract temporal domain features. Compared with previous related research, the proposed approach is able to capture dynamic spatial dependencies of traffic networks. A series of comprehensive case studies on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ST-GAT supersedes existing state-of-the-art results of traffic speed prediction. Furthermore, outstanding robustness against noise and on reduced graphs of the proposed model has been demonstrated through the tests. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the continuous expansion of urban scales and the constant growth of traffic demands, it has become important to accurately predict the distribution of traffic flow so as to relieve the traffic jams and lower the energy consumption. This research mainly focuses on the distribution problem of traffic flow in the urban traffic network. A minimization program has been provided as an alternative formulation for the turning delay stochastic user equilibrium problem. The paper derives the Weibull distribution-based node-link random loading mechanism of turning delay for direct calculation of link and turning flows that are consistent with the path flow, thus avoiding the enumeration of turning paths. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the turning delay stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model and the node-link-based algorithm. The experiment demonstrates that the present method can reflect the relative performance of link and turning costs well, while presenting its advantages in the simulation of large-scale turning delay flow assignment. © 2018, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

AB  - Short-term traffic forecasting is becoming more important in intelligent transportation systems. The k-nearest neighbour (kNN) method is widely used for short-term traffic forecasting. However, the self-adjustment of kNN parameters has been a problem due to dynamic traffic characteristics. This study proposes a fully automatic dynamic procedure kNN (DP-kNN) that makes the kNN parameters self-adjustable and robust without predefined models or training for the parameters. A real-world dataset with more than one year traffic records is used to conduct experiments. The results show that the DP-kNN can perform better than the manually adjusted kNN and other benchmarking methods in terms of accuracy on average. This study also discusses the difference between holiday and workday traffic prediction as well as the usage of neighbour distance measurement. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.

AB  - The increasingly growing data traffic has posed great challenges for mobile operators to increase their data processing capacity, which incurs a significant energy consumption and deployment cost. With the emergence of the Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture, the data processing units can now be centralized in data centers and shared among base stations. By mapping a cluster of base stations with complementary traffic patterns to a data processing unit, the processing unit can be fully utilized in different periods of time, and the required capacity to be deployed is expected to be smaller than the sum of capacities of single base stations. However, since the traffic patterns of base stations are highly dynamic in different time and locations, it is challenging to foresee and characterize the traffic patterns in advance to make optimal clustering schemes. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a deep-learning-based C-RAN optimization framework. First, we exploit a Multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (MuLSTM) model to learn the temporal dependency and spatial correlation among base station traffic patterns, and make accurate traffic forecast for a future period of time. Afterwards, we build a weighted graph to model the complementarity of base stations according to their traffic patterns, and propose a Distance-Constrained Complementarity-Aware (DCCA) algorithm to find optimal base station clustering schemes with the objectives of optimizing capacity utility and deployment cost. We evaluate the performance of our framework using data in two months from real-world mobile networks in Milan and Trentino, Italy. Results show that our method effectively increases the average capacity utility to 83.4% and 76.7%, and reduces the overall deployment cost to 48.4% and 51.7% of the traditional RAN architecture in the two datasets, respectively, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper we propose an architecture for a city-wide traffic modeling and prediction service based on the Fog Computing paradigm. The work assumes an scenario in which a number of distributed antennas receive data generated by vehicles across the city. In the Fog nodes data is collected, processed in local and intermediate nodes, and finally forwarded to a central Cloud location for further analysis. We propose a combination of a data distribution algorithm, resilient to back-haul connectivity issues, and a traffic modeling approach based on deep learning techniques to provide distributed traffic forecasting capabilities. In our experiments, we leverage real traffic logs from one week of Floating Car Data (FCD) generated in the city of Barcelona by a road-assistance service fleet comprising thousands of vehicles. FCD was processed across several simulated conditions, ranging from scenarios in which no connectivity failures occurred in the Fog nodes, to situations with long and frequent connectivity outage periods. For each scenario, the resilience and accuracy of both the data distribution algorithm, and the learning methods were analyzed. Results show that the data distribution process running in the Fog nodes is resilient to back-haul connectivity issues and is able to deliver data to the Cloud location even in presence of severe connectivity problems. Additionally, the proposed traffic modeling and forecasting method exhibits better behavior when run distributed in the Fog instead of centralized in the Cloud, especially when connectivity issues occur that force data to be delivered out of order to the Cloud. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Traffic in operator networks is time varying. Conventional network functions implemented by black-boxes should satisfy the peak traffic requirement, and hence result in low resource utilization. Thanks to the emergence of Virtual Network Function (VNF), which is realized by running networking software on Virtual Machines (VMs), the operator can dynamically scale in or scale out the VNF instances and hence save the required resources. In this paper, we introduce how the dynamic VNF scaling is implemented in practical operator Data Center Networks (DCNs). First, we analyze the traffic characteristics in our operator networks, and introduce how the VNFs are organized in a common operator DCN. Based on these backgrounds, we not only propose a traffic forecasting method, but also design two VNF placement algorithms to guide the dynamic VNF instance scaling. Through both the implementation in a real operator network and extensive real trace driven simulations, we demonstrate that our dynamic VNF instance scaling system can achieve higher service availability and save the VNF resources (e.g., CPU and memory) by up to 30 percent. © 1990-2012 IEEE.

AB  - We present a constraint programming formulation for the elevator trip origin-destination matrix estimation problem using a lexicographic bi-criteria optimization method where least squares minimization is applied to the measured counts and the minimum information or the maximum entropy approach to the whole matrix. An elevator trip consists of successive stops in one direction of travel with passengers inside the elevator. It can be defined as a directed network, where the nodes correspond to the stops on the trip and the arcs to the possible origins and destinations of the passengers. The goal is to estimate the most likely counts of passengers for the origin-destination pairs of every elevator trip occurring in a building that are consistent with the measured boarding and alighting counts and any prior information about the trip matrix. These counts are used to make passenger traffic forecasts which, in turn, are used in elevator dispatching to reduce uncertainties related to future passengers and therefore to improve passenger service level. Artificial test data was obtained by simulations of lunch hour traffic in a typical multi-story office building. This resulted in complex problem instances that enable robust performance and quality testing. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous alternatives in terms of quality, and can take an advantage of prior information. In addition, the proposed approach satisfies real time elevator group control requirements for estimating elevator trip origin-destination matrices. Practical application: The elevator trip origin-destination matrix estimation problem is important since it makes it possible to obtain complete information and statistics about the elevator passenger traffic. The statistics can be used to model future passengers which, when taken into account in the elevator group control, helps to improve passenger service level. Simulation experiments show that most of the problems occurring in reality can be solved within a reasonable time considering a real application, and the solving algorithms are relatively easy to implement using available constraint programming tools. Hence, this work is undoubtedly of interest to the building and elevator industry. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Traffic growth forecasts announce a dramatic future for core networks, struggling to keep the pace of traffic augmentation. Internet traffic growth primarily stems from the proliferation of cloud services and the massive amounts of data distributed by the content delivery networks (CDNs) hosting these services. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of core traffic in the presence of growing CDNs. Expanding the capacities of existing data centers (DCs) directly translates the forecasted compound-annual-growth-rate (CAGR) of user traffic to the CAGR of carried core link traffic. On the other hand, expanding CDNs by building new geographically dispersed DCs can significantly reduce the predicted core traffic growth rates by placing content closer to the users. However, reducing DC-to-user traffic by building new DCs comes at a trade-off with increasing inter-DC content synchronization traffic. Thus, the resulting overall core traffic growth will depend on the types of services supported and their associated synchronization requirements. In this paper, we present a long-term evolution study to assess the implications of different CDN expansion strategies on core network traffic growth considering a mix of services in proportions and growth rates corresponding to well-known traffic forecasts. Our simulations indicate that CDNs may have significant incentive to build more DCs, depending on the service types they offer, and that current alarming traffic predictions may be somewhat overestimated in core networks in the presence of expanding CDNs. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Over the years, the rate of traffic growth had always been a significant concern in the development of road infrastructures as it could either lead to premature failure of the pavement or could result in the wastage of valuable resources. The lack of proper study regarding the prediction of traffic growth has led to development of concerns in this field. The present study attempts to develop traffic forecasting models using the data collected from 2013 to 2017at the Paliyekkara toll plaza situated in southern part of India. The study identified Gross Domestic Product, population and vehicle ownership as the main factors that influence traffic growth and an exponential model was developed relating these factors with traffic volume. The proposed model was then validated by comparing the forecasted traffic with the actual traffic data of 2018. Further, on comparing with the output from existing models, it was concluded that the proposed model outperforms the available models as it had the least error in prediction. The study also modeled the variation in traffic volume that occurs in a year and this could be used to forecast the traffic for any particular month of any year. © 2019 Institute for Transport Studies in the European Economic Integration.

AB  - Short-term traffic flow prediction on a large-scale road network is challenging due to the complex spatial–temporal dependencies, the directed network topology, and the high computational cost. To address the challenges, this article develops a graph deep learning framework to predict large-scale network traffic flow with high accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, we model the dynamics of the traffic flow on a road network as an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain on a directed graph. Based on the representation, a novel spatial–temporal graph inception residual network (STGI-ResNet) is developed for network-based traffic prediction. This model integrates multiple spatial–temporal graph convolution (STGC) operators, residual learning, and the inception structure. The proposed STGC operators can adaptively extract spatial–temporal features from multiple traffic periodicities while preserving the topology information of the road network. The proposed STGI-ResNet inherits the advantages of residual learning and inception structure to improve prediction accuracy, accelerate the model training process, and reduce difficult parameter tuning efforts. The computational complexity is linearly related to the number of road links, which enables citywide short-term traffic prediction. Experiments using a car-hailing traffic data set at 10-, 30-, and 60-min intervals for a large road network in a Chinese city shows that the proposed model outperformed various state-of-the-art baselines for short-term network traffic flow prediction. © 2019 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering

AB  - Spatiotemporal prediction modeling of traffic is an important issue in the field of spatiotemporal data mining. However, it is encountering multiple challenges such as the global spatiotemporal correlation between predictive tasks, balanced between spatiotemporal heterogeneity and the global predictive power of the model, and parameter optimization of prediction models. Most existing short-term traffic prediction methods only emphasize spatiotemporal dependence and heterogeneity, so it is difficult to get satisfactory prediction accuracy. In this paper, spatiotemporal multi-task and multi-view feature learning models based on particle swarm optimization are combined to concurrently address these challenges. First, cross-correlation is used to construct the spatiotemporal proximity view, periodic view and trend view of each road segment to characterize spatiotemporal dependence and heterogeneity. Second, the prediction results of three spatiotemporal views are obtained using a set of kernels, which is further regarded as a high-level heterogeneous semantic feature as the input of the multi-task multi-view feature learning model. Third, additional regularization terms (e.g., group Lasso penalty, graph Laplacian regularization) are utilized to constrain all tasks to select a set of shared features and ensure the relatedness between tasks and consistency between views, so that the predictive model has a good global predictive ability and can capture global spatiotemporal correlation in the road network. Finally, particle swarm optimization is introduced to obtain the optimal parameter set and enhance the training speed of the proposed model. Experimental studies on real vehicular-speed datasets collected on city roads demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperform the existing nine baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy. The results suggest that the proposed model merits further attention for other spatiotemporal prediction tasks, such as water quality, crowd flow, owing to the versatility of the modeling process for spatiotemporal data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to assess the traffic situations of the existing system by evaluating the Level of service as a key component. Traffic survey have been carried out for the analysis of AADT, Design service volume, capacity and Leve of Service of the city road networks. By using AADT, the LOS have been estimated for the analysis of future traffic condition. Peak hour traffic survey data have been collected for the analysis of AADT and Level of Service. LOS has been converted into percentile form for the analysis of the future LOS. It has been observed that the LOS of the roads of the major traffic operations have mostly same LOS in the morning & evening peak hours which signifies that the traffic movement and the pattern of movement are same in both the traffic session of peak hours. The rapid decrease in LOS has been presented in results, which means, LOS will reduce from time to time and the unimproved existing traffic system will create a problem for motorists and pedestrians. Hence, the existing traffic systems must be evaluated in order to cope with future traffic demands and problems. © 2019 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data streams have arisen as a relevant topic during the last few years as an efficient method for extracting knowledge from big data. In the robust layered ensemble model (RLEM) proposed in this paper for short-term traffic flow forecasting, incoming traffic flow data of all connected road links are organized in chunks corresponding to an optimal time lag. The RLEM model is composed of two layers. In the first layer, we cluster the chunks by using the Graded Possibilistic c-Means method. The second layer is made up by an ensemble of forecasters, each of them trained for short-term traffic flow forecasting on the chunks belonging to a specific cluster. In the operational phase, as a new chunk of traffic flow data presented as input to the RLEM, its memberships to all clusters are evaluated, and if it is not recognized as an outlier, the outputs of all forecasters are combined in an ensemble, obtaining in this a way a forecasting of traffic flow for a short-term time horizon. The proposed RLEM model is evaluated on a synthetic data set, on a traffic flow data simulator and on two real-world traffic flow data sets. The model gives an accurate forecasting of the traffic flow rates with outlier detection and shows a good adaptation to non-stationary traffic regimes. Given its characteristics of outlier detection, accuracy, and robustness, RLEM can be fruitfully integrated in traffic flow management systems. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Maritime regulators, port authorities, and industry require the ability to predict risk exposure of shipping activities at a micro and macro level to optimize asset allocation and to mitigate and prevent incidents. This article introduces the concept of a strategic planning tool by making use of the multi-layered risk estimation framework (MLREF), which accounts for ship specific risk, vessel traffic densities, and meets ocean conditions at the macro level. This article’s main contribution is to provide a traffic and risk exposure prediction routine that allows the traffic forecast to be distributed across the shipping route network to allow for predicting scenarios at the macro level (e.g., covering larger geographic areas) and micro level (e.g., passage way, particular route of interest). In addition, the micro level is introduced by providing a theoretical idea to integrate location specific spatial rate ratios along with the effect of the risk control option to perform sensitivity analysis of risk exposure prediction scenarios. Aspects of the risk exposure estimation routine were tested via a pilot study for the Australian region using a comprehensive and unique combination of datasets. Sources of uncertainties for risk assessments are described in general and discussed along with the potential for future developments and improvements. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Graph convolutional neural networks have aroused more and more attentions on account of the ability to handle the graph-structured data defined on irregular or non-Euclidean domains. Different from the data defined on regular grids, each node in the graph-structured data has different number of neighbors, and the interactions and correlations between nodes vary at different locations, resulting in complex graph structure. However, the existing graph convolutional neural networks generally pay little attention to exploiting the graph structure information. Moreover, most existing graph convolutional neural networks employ the weight sharing strategy which lies on the statistical assumption of stationarity. This assumption is not always verified on the graph-structured data. To address these issues, we propose a method that learns Graph Structure via graph Convolutional Networks (GSCN), which introduces the graph structure parameters measuring the correlation degrees of adjacent nodes. The graph structure parameters are constantly modified the graph structure during the training phase and will help the filters of the proposed method to focus on the relevant nodes in each neighborhood. Meanwhile by combining the graph structure parameters and kernel weights, our method, which relaxes the restriction of weight sharing, is better to handle the graph-structured data of non-stationarity. In addition, the non-linear activation function ReLU and the sparse constraint are employed on the graph structure parameters to promote GSCN to focus on the important links and filter out the insignificant links in each neighborhood. Experiments on various tasks, including text categorization, molecular activity detection, traffic forecasting and skeleton-based action recognition, illustrate the validity of our method. © 2019

AB  - Traffic demand in access networks has grown in recent years, and service providers need to upgrade their infrastructure to the latest access standards. While fiber has become the preferred technology of choice in access networks, there are many fibre access technologies available in the market. This poses challenging questions to operators that are not always easy to answer: How to upgrade? What technology and for how long wil it cope with the demands? In this article we model the traffic forecast in access networks for the next decade and analyze possible upgrade scenarios of fibre access networks, concluding which of the NG-PON flavors could better fit the demand. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting is a useful technology applied to solve traffic congestion problems and to improve transportation mobility. Neural networks related approaches have been applied to develop traffic forecasting models for more than two decades. Since neural networks are sensitivity in parameters selection, selecting appropriate modeling configuration is essential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of traffic flow prediction. However, this is usually conducted by the trial-And-error method, which is very time consuming while involving too many design factors. Therefore, this paper utilizes a robust and systematic optimization approach, the Taguchi method, for obtaining the optimized configuration of the proposed exponential smoothing and extreme learning machine forecasting model. The developed model is applied to real-world data collected from freeways and highways in the United Kingdom and is compared with three existing forecasting models. The results indicate that the Taguchi method is efficient and capable for the forecasting model design and the proposed model with the optimized configuration has superior performance in traffic flow forecasting with approximate 91% and 88% accuracy rate in freeway and highway in both peak and nonpeak traffic periods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Vehicle flow forecasting is of crucial importance for the management of road traffic in complex urban networks, as well as a useful input for route planning algorithms. In general traffic predictive models rely on data gathered by different types of sensors placed on roads, which occasionally produce faulty readings due to several causes, such as malfunctioning hardware or transmission errors. Filling in those gaps is relevant for constructing accurate forecasting models, a task which is engaged by diverse strategies, from a simple null value imputation to complex spatio-temporal context imputation models. This work elaborates on two machine learning approaches to update missing data with no gap length restrictions: a spatial context sensing model based on the information provided by surrounding sensors, and an automated clustering analysis tool that seeks optimal pattern clusters in order to impute values. Their performance is assessed and compared to other common techniques and different missing data generation models over real data captured from the city of Madrid (Spain). The newly presented methods are found to be fairly superior when portions of missing data are large or very abundant, as occurs in most practical cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Smart traffic prediction system provides significant benefits in solving the city traffic congestion. However, existing smart transportation system needs a lot of real-time traffic data and accurate location information to display the traffic condition. We hope that we can use the data which is easy to be obtained, and then predict a reliable congestion time. To address this problem, this paper studied a smart traffic forecasting system based on SWARIMA model. The system includes three steps: 1) use the sliding windows to calculate and process real-time data stream; 2) establish the SWARIMA model and make regression analysis; and 3) from a statistical point of view, calculate the elastic interval and predict the congestion trend. Our system is capable of accepting the real-time traffic data stream for the congestion prediction, in addition, we reduce the actual running parameters to three attributes: 1) speed; 2) time; and 3) location information. When faced with the challenges of real-time traffic congestion, the system can timely and effectively calculate the congestion trends and provide three reliable elastic intervals: 1) warning; 2) congestion; and 3) mitigation, which has significance to improve traffic condition and alleviate urban road congestion. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Forecasting the traffic flow is greatly significant for traffic safety, energy conservation, and environmental protection. However, in the face of many external uncertainties, making accurate predictions about traffic volumes is a challenging issue. Many previous types of researche only explore the utility of a single factor in their prediction and rarely conduct the multi-factor research. As for the traffic flow prediction, many past types of researche focus primarily on the temporal distribution of the traffic flow on a single point on the road, ignoring the spatial correlation. In terms of global forecasting, it was logically far-fetched to mechanically view traffic as images. In this paper, considering the effects of many exogenous variables and the interaction between monitor sites, we propose a hybrid model to simultaneously predict the traffic flow in multiple positions by combining the layerwise structure and the Markov transition matrix (MTM). More specifically, we employ the layerwise structure to capture the periodicity, trend, and nonlinearity characteristics of traffic flow and, then, generate the MTM that captures the dynamics embodied in the data and produces the corresponding distributions. Considering the spatial correlation of traffic data, the real road network distance was thus introduced in our model. We apply the methodology on the real-world traffic data from Xiamen, and the experimental results show that the satisfactory predictions can be achieved using our model, which demonstrates the value of the transition matrix in traffic forecasts. In addition, we also introduce the point of interest and analyze its impact on the prediction results. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of predicting self-similar traffic with a significant number of pulsations and the property of long-term dependence, using various spline functions. The research work focused on the process of modeling self-similar traffic handled in a mobile network. A spline-extrapolation method based on various spline functions (linear, cubic and cubic B-splines) is proposed to predict self-similar traffic outside the period of time in which packet data transmission occurs. Extrapolation of traffic for short- and long-term forecasts is considered. Comparison of the results of the prediction of self-similar traffic using various spline functions has shown that the accuracy of the forecast can be improved through the use of cubic B-splines. The results allow to conclude that it is advisable to use spline extrapolation in predicting self-similar traffic, thereby recommending this method for use in practice in solving traffic prediction-related problems. © 2019 National Institute of Telecommunications.

AB  - The paper proposes a model-based framework for estimating traffic states from Eulerian (loop) and/or Lagrangian (probe) data. Lagrangian-Space formulation of the LWR model adopted as the underlying traffic model provides suitable properties for receiving both Eulerian and Lagrangian external information. Three independent methods are proposed to address Eulerian data, Lagrangian data and the combination of both, respectively. These methods are defined in a consistent framework so as to be implemented simultaneously. The proposed framework has been verified on the synthetic data derived from the same underlying traffic flow model. Strength and weakness of both data sources are discussed. Next, the proposed framework has been applied to a freeway corridor. The validity has been tested using the data from a microscopic simulator, and the performance is satisfactory even for low rate of probe vehicles around 5%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To capture network dependence between traffic links, we introduce two distinct network weight matrices ((Formula presented.)), which replace spatial weight matrices used in traffic forecasting methods. The first stands on the notion of betweenness centrality and link vulnerability in traffic networks. To derive this matrix, we use an unweighted betweenness method and assume all traffic flow is assigned to the shortest path. The other relies on flow rate change in traffic links. For forming this matrix, we use the flow information of traffic links and employ user equilibrium assignment and the method of successive averages algorithm to solve the network. The components of the network weight matrices are a function not simply of adjacency, but of network topology, network structure, and demand configuration. We test and compare the network weight matrices in different traffic conditions using the Nguyen–Dupuis network. The results lead to a conclusion that the network weight matrices operate better than traditional spatial weight matrices. Comparing the unweighted and flow-weighted network weight matrices, we also reveal that the assigned flow network weight matrices perform two times better than a betweenness network weight matrix, particularly in congested traffic conditions. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Short term traffic forecasting is one of the important fields of study in the transportation domain. Short term traffic forecasting is very useful to develop a more advanced transportation system to control traffic signals and avoid congestions. Several studies have made efforts for short term traffic flow forecasting for divided and undivided highways across the world. However, all these studies relied on the dataset which are greatly varied between countries due to the technology used for transportation data collection. India is a developing country in which efforts are being done to improve the transportation system to avoid congestion and travel time. Two-lane undivided highways with mixed traffic constitute a large portion of Indian road network. This study is an attempt to develop a short term traffic forecasting model using back propagation artificial neural network for two lane undivided highway with mixed traffic conditions in India. The results were compared with random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor classifier, regression tree and multiple regression models. It was found that back-propagation neural network performs better than other approaches and achieved an R2 value 0.9962, which is a good score. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The traditional fuzzy neural network often uses BP algorithm to optimize parameters when conducting parameter identification. However, BP algorithm tends to be trapped in local extremum. In view of the shortcomings of this method, this paper combines the differential evolution algorithm with the BP algorithm, and proposes an improved differential evolution BP algorithm to optimize the fuzzy neural network forecasting network traffic. In order to solve problems such as slow convergence speed and tendency of premature convergence existing in differential evolution algorithm, an improved differential evolution algorithm using the adaptive mutation operator and Gaussian disturbance crossover operator aims to improve the mutation of standard differential evolution algorithm and the design of crossover operators. To validate the effectiveness of it, this optimized fuzzy neural network forecasting algorithm is applied to four standard test functions and the actual network traffic. Simulation results show that the convergence speed and forecasting accuracy of the proposed algorithm are better than those of the traditional fuzzy neural network algorithm. It improves not only the generalization ability of the fuzzy neural network but also the forecasting accuracy of the network traffic. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study models the joint evolution (over calendar time) of travelers’ departure time and mode choices, and the resulting traffic dynamics in a bi-modal transportation system. Specifically, we consider that, when adjusting their departure time and mode choices, travelers can learn from their past travel experiences as well as the traffic forecasts offered by the smart transport information provider/agency. At the same time, the transport agency can learn from historical data in updating traffic forecast from day to day. In other words, this study explicitly models and analyzes the dynamic interactions between transport users and traffic information provider. Besides, the impact of user inertia is taken into account in modeling the traffic dynamics. When exploring the convergence of the proposed model to the dynamic bi-modal commuting equilibrium, we find that appropriate traffic forecast can help the system converge to the user equilibrium. It is also found that user inertia might slow down the convergence speed of the day-to-day evolution model. Extensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to account for the impacts of inaccurate parameters adopted by the transport agency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Fehmarn Belt is a strait between Denmark and Germany, currently served by a ferry operator. We analyse competition between the ferry service and a planned tunnel, the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link. We develop a differentiated duopoly model to address two questions: 1. Will the tunnel induce the ferry to exit the market once it operates? 2. Will the tunnel's toll revenue suffice to cover its cost? Using real-world data and traffic forecasts, we show that it should not be taken for granted that the ferry will exit the market, and that if the ferry competes, the tunnel project will make a loss. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aiming at the long-range dependence and short-range dependence characteristics of backbone network traffic, a traffic forecasting model based on Modified Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEEMD) and Quantum Neural Network (QNN) is presented. Firstly, the MEEMD method is employed to decompose the traffic data sequence into intrinsic mode function (IMF) component. Then, the Quantum Neural Network is adopted to forecast the IMF components. Ultimately, the final prediction value is obtained via synthe-tizing the prediction results of all components. The QNN is composed of universal quantum gates and quantum weighted, and its learning algorithm employs the Modified Polak–Ribière–Polyak Conjugate Gradient method. The forecast results on real network traffic show that the proposed algorithm has a lower computational complexity and higher prediction accuracy than that of EMD and Auto Regressive Moving Average, EMD and Support Vector Machines, EEMD and Artificial Neural Networks method. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study examines the spatiotemporal dependency between traffic links. We model the traffic flow of 140 traffic links in a sub-network of the Minneapolis-St. Paul highway system for both rush hour and non-rush hour time intervals, and validate the extracted network weight matrix. The results of the modeling indicate: (1) the spatial weight matrix is unstable over time-of-day, while the network weight matrix is robust in all cases and (2) the performance of the network weight matrix in non-rush hour traffic regimes is significantly better than rush hour traffic regimes. The results of the validation show the network weight matrix outperforms the traditional way of capturing spatial dependency between traffic links. Averaging over all traffic links and time, this superiority is about 13.2% in rush hour and 15.3% in non-rush hour, when only the first-order neighboring links are embedded in modeling. In addition, this study proposes a two-step algorithm to search and identify the best look-back time window for upstream links. We indicate the best look-back time window depends on the travel time between two study detectors, and it varies by time-of-day and traffic link. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Human mobility patterns have been widely investigated due to their application in a wide variety of fields, for example urban planning and epidemiology. Many studies have introduced spatial networks into human mobility analyses at the collective level. However, these studies merely analyzed spatial network structure, and the underlying collective mobility patterns were not further discussed. In this paper, we propose a collective mobility discovery method based on community differences (CMDCD). We constructed spatial networks where nodes represent geographical entities and edge weights denote collective mobility intensity between geographical entities. The differences between communities detected from the networks constructed in different periods were then identified. Since collective spatial movement has a large influence on network structure, we can discover groups with different mobility patterns based on community differences. By applying the method to data usage detail records collected from the cellular networks in a city of China, we analyzed different collective mobility patterns between the Spring Festival vacation and workdays. The experimental results show that our method can solve these two problems of identifying community differences and discovering users with different mobility patterns simultaneously. Moreover, the CMDCD method is an integrated approach to discover groups whose mobility patterns have changed in different periods at the large spatial scale and the small spatial scale. The discovered collective mobility patterns can be used to guide urban planning, traffic forecasting, urban resource allocation, providing new insights into human mobility patterns and spatial interaction analyses. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Road traffic is a major issue in cities with increasing population. An Efficient traffic management system is required to address this issue. Turning Movement (TM) count is used for such purposes. TM acts as an input parameter for traffic analysis models and forecasting tools. This paper discusses the optimization of Turning Moments' count which can be utilized to predict road traffic accurately using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. This is achieved by using path flow estimator to estimate traffic at hyperlink flows and Kalman filter to generate a dynamic model. Together the ANN model combined with a potent model with appearance constraint allows the model to consider special conditions and factors that affect the TM. Image capturing acts as the key concept to keep the count of TM more accurate and datasets are generated to save the data accordingly to keep features and size-match of the convoluted snapped of the vehicles. The representational model is used to solve matching ambiguities which can arise throughout dense traffic situations and occlusions and guarantees presenting consistency alongside a trajectory. The dynamic appearance model taken into consideration of the external factors that may affect the traffic movement and conditions like climate, road condition, natural calamity etc. And ensues presenting consistency alongside a trajectory. We combine these deep learning algorithms to get accurate and perfected value for development of future intersections and improvising the currents intersections. The proposed model enhances the TM counts' accuracy and helps in efficient traffic analysis. These TM count can be used for many other purposes in the future like traffic forecast and analyzing the traffic movements. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - Since satellite network traffic is self-similar and long-range-dependent (LRD), after analyzing current network traffic forecasting models, a satellite network traffic combined forecasting model that is based on the decomposition fruit fly optimization algorithm-extreme learning machine (FOA-ELM) is proposed. This forecasting model decomposes LRD network traffic into multiple short-range dependent (SRD) components via empirical mode decomposition (EMD), applies the FOA-ELM forecasting model to the decomposed high-frequency components, and applies the ELM forecasting model to low-frequency components. The simulation results show that the forecasting model can improve the forecasting accuracy and forecasting speed, reduce the complexity, and achieve effective and efficient forecasting of satellite network traffic. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Metro passenger flow forecasting is an essential component of intelligent transportation system. To enhance the forecasting accuracy and explainable of traditional models, a hybrid model combining symbolic regression and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) was proposed in this paper. It can take unique strength of each single model to capture the complexity patterns beneath data structure. Using the real data from Xi’an metro line 1, the performance of the hybrid model was compared with the ARIMA model and Back Propagation (BP) neural networks. The results show that the hybrid model outperforms other two models. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of hybrid models have an extra 54.24%, 58.98% increase over the BP neural networks and an extra 64.44%, 68.27% increase over the ARIMA models for entrance and exit respectively. In addition, the t-test of MAPE during workday and holiday reflects the hybrid model possesses comparable forecasting ability under different conditions. Moreover, with the increase of the prediction steps, the superiority of the proposed model is more significant. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Almost blank subframes (ABSs) have been defined in LTE as a means to coordinate transmissions in heterogeneous networks (HetNets), composed of macro and micro eNodeBs: the macro issues ABS periods, and refrains from transmitting during ABSs, thus creating interference-free subframes for the micros. Micros report their capacity demands to the macro via the X2 interface, and the latter provisions the ABS period accordingly. Existing algorithms for ABS provisioning usually share resources proportionally among HetNet nodes in a long-term perspective (e.g., based on traffic forecast). We argue instead that this mechanism can be exploited to save power in the HetNet: in fact, during ABSs, the macro consumes less power, since it only transmits pilot signals. Dually, the micros may inhibit data transmission themselves in some subframes, and optimally decide when to do this based on knowledge of the ABS period. This allows us to define a power saving framework that works in the short term, modifying the ABS pattern at the fastest possible pace, serving the HetNet traffic at reduced power cost. Our framework is designed using only standard signaling. Simulations show that the algorithm consumes less power than its competitors, especially, at low loads, and improves the UE QoS. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic control of urban areas is a current research topic. Different pricing regimes such as cordon pricing, time-based average cost zone pricing, distance-based average cost zone pricing or marginal cost zone pricing have been investigated so far. The economical best solution, however, cannot be used due to the lack of information. In the study, the future of road pricing together with traffic control is analysed with the assumption of widespread information and communications technology (ICT) usage, i.e. access to real-time information. The study proposes a utility-based dynamic road pricing for optimal traffic flow management. The research largely focused on the model and regulator definition [fixed, dynamic, and non-linear model predictive control (MPC)]. The theoretical research was conducted on a real-world traffic test network by applying different control methods and taking into account the time-delay effect of traffic forecasting. The simulation results show that time delay in response to vehicle concentration can result in significant oscillation on the concurrent routes in case of fixed and dynamic control, but can be compensated by non-linear MPC. As a major result, it is shown that with the market penetration of ICT, a new era of road tolling regimes could be introduced. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of dynamic travel time (DTT) forecasting within highway traffic networks using speed measurements. Definitions, computational details and properties in the construction of DTT are provided. DTT is dynamically clustered using a K-means algorithm and then information on the level and the trend of the centroid of the clusters is used to devise a predictor computationally simple to be implemented. To take into account the lack of information in the cluster assignment for the new predicted values, a weighted average fusion based on a similarity measurement is proposed to combine the predictions of each model. The algorithm is deployed in a real time application and the performance is evaluated using real traffic data from the South Ring of the Grenoble city in France. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic prediction, as an important part of intelligent transportation systems, plays a critical role in traffic state monitoring. While many studies accomplished traffic forecasting task with deep learning models, there is still an open issue of exploiting spatial-temporal traffic state features for better prediction performance, and the model interpretability has not been taken serious. In this study, we propose a path based deep learning framework which can produce better traffic speed prediction at a city wide scale, furthermore, the model is both rational and interpretable in the context of urban transportation. Specifically, we divide the road network into critical paths, which is helpful to mine the traffic flow mechanism. Then, each critical path is modeled through the bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (Bi-LSTM NN), and multiple Bi-LSTM layers are stacked to incorporate temporal information. At the stage of traffic prediction, the spatial-temporal features captured from these processes are fed into a fully-connected layer. Finally, results for each path are ensembled for network-wise traffic speed prediction. In the empirical studies, we compare the proposed model with multiple benchmark methods. Under a series of prediction scenarios (i.e., different input and prediction horizons), the superior performance of the proposed framework is validated. Moreover, by analyzing feature from hidden-layer output, the study explains the physical meaning of the hidden feature and illustrate model's interpretability. © 2019

AB  - Network traffic forecasting is an operational and management function that is critical for any data network. It is even more important for IoT networks given the number of connected elements and the real-time nature of many connections. This work presents a novel deep learning architecture applicable to this supervised regression problem. It is based on an additive network model formed by ‘learning blocks’ that are stacked iteratively following, in part, the principles of gradient boosting models. The resulting architecture is trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. This new architecture has connections with residual, stacked and boosted networks, being different from any of them. Like residual networks, it shows excellent convergence behavior during training and allows for deeper models. It has a regularization effect similar to stacked models and presents excellent prediction results as gradient boosting models do. The building elements of the architecture are neural network blocks or learning blocks, that can be constituted by a sequence of simple fully connected layers or by more elaborate dispositions of recurrent and convolutional layers. The resulting architecture is a generic additive network (gaNet) applicable to any supervised regression problem. To obtain experimental results on a hard prediction problem, the model is applied to the forecasting of network traffic using IoT traffic volume real data from a mobile operator. The paper presents a comprehensive comparison of results between the proposed new model and many alternative algorithms, showing important improvements in terms of prediction performance metrics and training/prediction processing times. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Predicting large-scale transportation network traffic has become an important and challenging topic in recent decades. Inspired by the domain knowledge of motion prediction, in which the future motion of an object can be predicted based on previous scenes, we propose a network grid representation method that can retain the fine-scale structure of a transportation network. Network-wide traffic speeds are converted into a series of static images and input into a novel deep architecture, namely, spatiotemporal recurrent convolutional networks (SRCNs), for traffic forecasting. The proposed SRCNs inherit the advantages of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The spatial dependencies of network-wide traffic can be captured by DCNNs, and the temporal dynamics can be learned by LSTMs. An experiment on a Beijing transportation network with 278 links demonstrates that SRCNs outperform other deep learning-based algorithms in both short-term and long-term traffic prediction. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The ever-increasing air traffic demand in China has brought huge pressure on the planning and management of, and investment in, air terminals as well as airline companies. In this context, accurate and adequate short-term air traffic forecasting is essential for the operations of those entities. In consideration of such a problem, a hybrid air traffic forecasting model based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) has been proposed in this paper. The model proposed decomposes the original time series into components at first, and models each component with the SARIMA forecasting model, then integrates all the models together to form the final combined forecast result. By using the monthly air cargo and passenger flow data from the years 2006 to 2014 available at the official website of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the effectiveness in forecasting of the model proposed has been demonstrated, and by a horizontal performance comparison between several other widely used forecasting models, the advantage of the proposed model has also been proved. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the nature of traffic itself, most traffic forecasting models reported in literature aim at producing short-term predictions, yet their performance degrades when the prediction horizon is increased. The scarce long-term estimation strategies currently found in the literature are commonly based on the detection and assignment to patterns, but their performance decays when unexpected events provoke non predictable changes, or if the allocation to a traffic pattern is inaccurate. This work introduces a method to obtain long-term pattern forecasts and adapt them to real-time circumstances. To this end, a long-term estimation scheme based on the automated discovery of patterns is proposed and integrated with an on-line change detection and adaptation mechanism. The framework takes advantage of the architecture of evolving Spiking Neural Networks (eSNN) to perform adaptations without retraining the model, allowing the whole system to work autonomously in an on-line fashion. Its performance is assessed over a real scenario with 5 min data of a 6-month span of traffic in the center of Madrid, Spain. Significant accuracy gains are obtained when applying the proposed on-line adaptation mechanism on days with special, non-predictable events that degrade the quality of their long-term traffic forecasts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The traffic flow forecasting is very important aspect of traffic predication and congestion. It alleviates the increasing congestion problems that cause drivers to shorten the travelling duration required and prevent financial loss. Increasing congestion is one of the severe problems in big city areas. The aspect of traffic prediction is that it may give drivers to plan their traveling time and traveling path, based on the predictive data information they have. The aim is to design locally weighted regression model by proposing a method, which is a combination of Genetic algorithm and locally weighted regression method. This model helps to achieve optimal prediction performance under various traffic condition parameters. The time series model is used to predict the forecast value for the accurate assumption of the traffic volume generation according to the road capacity. The GA model results show these kind of predictions always be useful for highway road authorities. © BEIESP.

AB  - Introduction: The planning of transport infrastructures in France has been marked by three major developments: the European reform concerning the opening of rail transport to competition, the privatisation of semi-public motorway concession-holding companies, and the use of public-private partnership contracts. This article proposes examining the following research question: how to plan a series of infrastructure projects within an uncertain context? The methodology: (i) analyses whether the objectives (traffic, travel time, safety, cost, socio-economic profitability, financial profitability) of the 12 motorway and HSL projects built since the 1990s have been attained with the new planning procedure (such as risk management methods, financial risk assessment, impact assessment, public consultation) (ii) compares the additional costs and delays for three HSL projects according to their type of financing and whether or not they have used these planning procedures. Results: The analysis shows that traffic levels are lower than forecasts for 8 projects. The cost is greater than the forecasts for all infrastructures. The socio-economic profitability and the financial profitability are also lower than forecasts for approximately two-thirds of the projects. Conclusion: The social, political, institutional and environmental risks are generally well identified and treated by the client, no matter whether public or private. The risk of additional cost is less well covered. The traffic risk remains a topical issue. Anticipating risks is liable to produce other risks, such as overcosts or opposition. It seems necessary to deepen the traffic forecast studies and to develop the multi criteria analysis method that can take account of the different points of view from the consultation. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Recent growth in demand for proactive real-time transportation management systems has led to major advances in short-time traffic forecasting methods. Recent studies have introduced time series theory, neural networks, and genetic algorithms to short-term traffic forecasting to make forecasts more reliable, efficient, and accurate. However, most of these methods can only deal with data recorded at regular time intervals, which restricts the range of data collection tools to presence-type detectors or other equipment that generates regular data. The study reported here is an attempt to extend several existing time series forecasting methods to accommodate data recorded at irregular time intervals, which would allow transportation management systems to obtain predicted traffic speeds from intermittent data sources such as Global Positioning System (GPS). To improve forecasting performance, acceleration information was introduced, and information from segments adjacent to the current forecasting segment was adopted. The study tested several methods using GPS data from 480 Hong Kong taxis. The results show that the best performance in terms of mean absolute relative error is obtained by using a neural network model that aggregates speed information and acceleration information from the current forecasting segment and adjacent segments. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - A dozen approaches such as extrapolation of previous traffic counts, trip rates based on expected future land development, and application of regional travel demand models can be used to forecast traffic volumes. Because of Virginia's interest in knowing the accuracy of forecasting approaches, the researchers compared previous Virginia forecasts with observed volumes. These comparisons revealed five observations affecting how accuracy is evaluated. First, the statistic used to aggregate individual link forecast errors may influence the perception of accuracy; for one study, two percentage-based statistics-the median percentage error and the mean absolute percentage error-yielded errors of 2% and 43%, respectively. (An implication is that the appropriate error statistic depends on the forecast's purpose.) Second, the accuracy of different types of traffic forecasts varies by magnitude; the median absolute percentage error for Virginia studies ranged from 12% (for a site-specific land development study) to 72% (for statewide forecasts based on historic traffic volumes). Third, because of differences in geometry and the frequency of counts, there may not be a direct relationship between a link's forecast and its observed volume; in one study, the error ranged from almost 0% to 36%, depending on how the forecast and observed volumes were compared. Fourth, some methods require input data that must be forecast, and different indications of accuracy result (e.g., mean absolute percentage errors of 13% versus 34% for the Fratar method) depending on whether the input data are forecast with or without error. Fifth, depending on the chosen decision criterion, large errors may not necessarily affect the actions taken.

AB  - Air traffic in Europe is predicted to increase considerably over the next decades. In this context, we present a study of the interactions between the costs due to ground-holding regulations and the costs due to en-route air traffic control. We dulator that considers the regulation delays, aircraft trajectories, and air conflict resolution. Through intensive simulations based on traffic forecasts extrapolated from French traffic data for 2012, we compute the regulation delays and avoidance maneuvers according to two scenarios: the current regulations and no regulations. The resulting cost analysis highlights the exponential growth in regulation costs that can be expected if the procedures and the airspace capacity do not change. Compared to the delay costs, the costs of the air traffic control are negligible with or without regulation. The analysis reveals the heavy controller workloads when there are no regulations, suggesting the need for regulations that are appropriate for large traffic volumes and an improved ATC system. These observations motivate the design of a third scenario that computes the sector capacities to find a compromise between the increase in the delay costs due to ground-holding regulations and the increase in the controller workload. The results reveal the sensitivity of the delay costs to the sector capacity; this information will be useful for further research into ATM sector capacity and ATC automated tool design. Finally, because of the growing interest in the free flight paradigm, we also perform a traffic and cost analysis for aircraft following direct routes. The results obtained highlight the fuel and time savings and the spatial restrictions that companies use to avoid congested areas. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The interdependence between machine-type communication (MTC) and human-to-human (H2H) communication has become a major topic for the development of cellular communication systems. One example of MTC application is dynamic traffic forecast, which uses sensors that are mounted on cars as an information source (so-called extended floating car data). To reduce the impact of MTC traffic on the quality of service (QoS) of human users, this paper presents a client-controlled channel-aware transmission (CAT) strategy. A new Markovian model of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) radio resources assuming heterogeneous MTC and H2H traffic is used to evaluate the performance of this approach. The close-to-reality parameterization of the model is achieved by laboratory LTE data rate measurement campaigns and ray-tracing analyses. The model demonstrates that the CAT scheme decreases the LTE cell utilization and improves the QoS in terms of blocking probability of H2H communication. The results regarding CAT are validated in an independent simulation and by LTE field measurements. Beyond this, the influence of different MTC traffic models, including best- and worst-case investigations, is provided. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Today has shown that modern traffic in data networks is highly correlated, making it necessary to select this kind of models that capture autocorrelation characteristics governing data flows surrounding on the network [1]. Being able to perform accurate forecasting of traffic on communication networks, this has great importance at present, since it influences decisions as important such as network sizing and predestination. The main purpose in this paper is to put into context the reader about the importance of statistical models of time series, it enable for estimating future traffic forecasts in modern communications networks, and becomes an essential tool for traffic prediction, This prediction according to the individual needs of each network are listed in estimates with long range dependence (LDR) and short-range dependence (SDR), each one providing a specific control, appropriate and efficient integrated at different levels of the network functional hierarchy [2]. But for the traffic forecasts in the modern communication networks must define the type of network to study and time series model that fits the same, which is why you should first select the type of network. For this case study, is a Wi-Fi network as the traffic behavior requires the development of a time series model with advanced statistics, that allows an integrated observing network and thus provide a tool to facilitate the monitoring and management of the same. According to this the type of time series model to use for this case are the ARIMA time series.

AB  - Optical-wireless convergence is identified as a promising solution to facilitate quality-of-service (QoS)-guaranteed, ubiquitous, and high-bandwidth access to end users. Different converged network architectures can be deployed depending on individual circumstances to achieve improved performance without compromising cost-effectiveness. However, with different network architectures, different resource allocation mechanisms are required to achieve the best performance. This is problematic in both the deployment and operational phases. In this paper, we propose an architecture discovery enabled resource allocation (ADERA) mechanism for the long term evolution (LTE)-gigabit Ethernet passive optical network (GEPON) converged network. The proposed ADERA is a self-adaptive algorithm ¿ it discovers the underlying architecture of the network by analyzing control signals and eventually evolves into an effective resource handling mechanism for the respective architecture. In addition, ADERA leverages inherited features of both the LTE network and GEPON in conjunction with the characteristics of their frame structures to improve the overall network performance. For example, ADERA is incorporated with a near-future traffic forecasting mechanism for efficient resource allocation. Using simulations, we evaluate the performance of our proposed ADERA algorithm and compare it against other existing resource allocation mechanisms. Our results indicate that ADERA achieves improved QoS performance in the converged network irrespective of the architecture used for the deployment. © 2013 OSA.

AB  - The widespread application of the Automatic Identification System has had a revolutionary impact on navigation technology. In terms of its impact on a vessel traffic service, it provides rich and real-time data on the vessels, which can be used for identification, tracking, and monitoring of vessels. The Automatic Identification System rapidly accumulates large volumes of data, and these data contain a very large number of implicit maritime traffic rules and characteristics, and thus, effective methods are needed to discover the knowledge contained therein. In this research, data warehouse and online analysis process technologies, which are utilized by ordinary business entities for large-quantity business information analysis, are applied to analyze Automatic Identification System information collected through a vessel traffic service. Automatic Identification System raw data collected in a harbor area are used for analysis and post-processing using the geographic information system and database technology, and the processed data with time and space characteristics are stored in an Automatic Identification System data warehouse. In addition, online analysis process technology, the Geographic Information System, and pivot analysis are utilized to perform rapid multidimensional, meaningful high-level information inquiries, analysis of marine traffic characteristics, and rule discovery in marine traffic. These can be used as references for port development planning, traffic forecasting, navigation safety assessment, and making other policy decisions. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - With rare exception, actual tollroad traffic in many countries has failed to reproduce forecast traffic levels, regardless of whether the assessment is made after an initial year of operation or as long as 10 years after opening. Pundits have offered many reasons for this divergence, including optimism bias, strategic misrepresentation, the promise to equity investors of early returns on investment, errors in land use forecasts, and specific assumptions underlying the traffic assignment models used to develop traffic forecasts. One such assumption is the selection of a behaviourally meaningful value of travel time savings (VTTS) for use in a generalised cost or generalised time user benefit expression that is the main behavioural feature of the traffic assignment (route choice) model. Numerous empirical studies using stated choice experiments have designed choice sets of alternatives as if users choose a tolled route or a free route under the (implied) assumption that the tolled route is tolled for the entire trip. Reality is often very different, with a high incidence of use of a non-tolled road leading into and connecting out of a tolled link. In this paper we recognise this feature of route choice and redesign the stated choice experiment to account for it. Furthermore, this study is a follow up to a previous study undertaken before a new toll road was in place, and it benefits from real exposure to the new toll road. We find that the VTTS is noticeably reduced, and if the VTTS is a significant contributing influence on errors on traffic forecasts, then the lower estimates make sense behaviourally. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - We have compared Swedish national forecasts for passenger transport produced from 1975 to 2009 with the actual outcomes, and we found substantial differences between forecasts of passenger kilometers by mode and actual outcomes. In forecasts produced since the early 1990 s, road and air traffic growth rates have generally been overpredicted. Aggregate railway growth has been fairly accurate, but commercial long-distance railway growth has been overpredicted, and the growth of subsidized intra-regional railway travel has been underpredicted (following vast unanticipated supply increases). Focusing on car traffic forecasts, we show that a very large share of forecast errors can be explained by input variables turning out to be different than what was assumed in the forecasts. Even the original forecasts are much closer to actual outcomes than simple trendlines would have been, and once the input assumptions are corrected, the forecasts vastly outperform simple trendlines. The potential problems of using cross-sectional models for forecasting intertemporal changes thus seem to be limited. This tentative conclusion is also supported by the finding that elasticities from the cross-sectional models are consistent with those from a time-series model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model is an effective statistical model applied in short-term traffic forecasting that can provide reliable data to guide travelers. This study proposes an improved KNN model to enhance forecasting accuracy based on spatiotemporal correlation and to achieve multistep forecasting. The physical distances among road segments are replaced with equivalent distances, which are defined by the static and dynamic data collected from real road networks. The traffic state of a road segment is described by a spatiotemporal state matrix instead of only a time series as in the original KNN model. The nearest neighbors are selected according to the Gaussian weighted Euclidean distance, which adjusts the influences of time and space factors on spatiotemporal state matrices. The forecasting accuracies of the improved KNN and of four other models are compared, and experimental results indicate that the improved KNN model is more appropriate for short-term traffic multistep forecasting than the other models are. This study also discusses the application of the improved KNN model in a time-varying traffic state. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Modern traffic sensors can measure various road traffic variables such as the traffic flow and average speed. However, some measurements can lead to incorrect data which cannot further be used in subsequent processing tasks such as traffic prediction or intelligent control. In this paper, we propose a method selecting a subset of input sensors for a support vector regression (SVR) model which is used for traffic prediction. The method is based on a multimodal and multiobjective NSGA-II algorithm. The multiobjective approach allowed us to find a good trade-off between the prediction error and the number of sensors in real-world situations when many traffic data measurements are unavailable. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Since the early 1980s, short-term traffic forecasting has been an integral part of most Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research and applications; most effort has gone into developing methodologies that can be used to model traffic characteristics and produce anticipated traffic conditions. Existing literature is voluminous, and has largely used single point data from motorways and has employed univariate mathematical models to predict traffic volumes or travel times. Recent developments in technology and the widespread use of powerful computers and mathematical models allow researchers an unprecedented opportunity to expand horizons and direct work in 10 challenging, yet relatively under researched, directions. It is these existing challenges that we review in this paper and offer suggestions for future work. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Didi Dache app is China's biggest taxi booking mobile app and is popular in cities. Unsurprisingly, short-term traffic demand forecasting is critical to enabling Didi Dache to maximize use by drivers and ensure that riders can always find a car whenever and wherever they may need a ride. In this paper, a short-term traffic demand forecasting model, Wave SVM, is proposed. It combines the complementary advantages of Daubechies5 wavelets analysis and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) models while it overcomes their respective shortcomings. This method includes four stages: in the first stage, original data are preprocessed; in the second stage, these data are decomposed into high-frequency and low-frequency series by wavelet; in the third stage, the prediction stage, the LS-SVM method is applied to train and predict the corresponding high-frequency and low-frequency series; in the last stage, the diverse predicted sequences are reconstructed by wavelet. The real taxi-hailing orders data are applied to evaluate the model's performance and practicality, and the results are encouraging. The Wave SVM model, compared with the prediction error of state-of-the-art models, not only has the best prediction performance but also appears to be the most capable of capturing the nonstationary characteristics of the short-term traffic dynamic systems.

AB  - Traffic flow is widely recognized as an important parameter for road traffic state forecasting. Fuzzy state transform and Kalman filter (KF) have been applied in this field separately. But the studies show that the former method has good performance on the trend forecasting of traffic state variation but always involves several numerical errors. The latter model is good at numerical forecasting but is deficient in the expression of time hysteretically. This paper proposed an approach that combining fuzzy state transform and KF forecasting model. In considering the advantage of the two models, a weight combination model is proposed. The minimum of the sum forecasting error squared is regarded as a goal in optimizing the combined weight dynamically. Real detection data are used to test the efficiency. Results indicate that the method has a good performance in terms of short-term traffic forecasting.

AB  - Short-term traffic forecast is one of the essential issues in intelligent transportation system. Accurate forecast result enables commuters make appropriate travel modes, travel routes, and departure time, which is meaningful in traffic management. To promote the forecast accuracy, a feasible way is to develop a more effective approach for traffic data analysis. The availability of abundant traffic data and computation power emerge in recent years, which motivates us to improve the accuracy of short-term traffic forecast via deep learning approaches. A novel traffic forecast model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed. Different from conventional forecast models, the proposed LSTM network considers temporal-spatial correlation in traffic system via a two-dimensional network which is composed of many memory units. A comparison with other representative forecast models validates that the proposed LSTM network can achieve a better performance. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.

AB  - A network traffic time series analysis and forecasting method based on wavelet decomposition is proposed in the paper. Firstly, non-stationary network traffic time series are decomposed into multiple stationary components, then various stationary components are modeled using the autoregressive moving average method and at last models of all components are composed to get the prediction model for original non-stationary network traffic time series. In the simulation experiment, we used time series data from the network traffic library to establish a prediction model and carried out independent test and inspection. Simulation test results show that the forecasting method proposed in this paper has improved forecasting accuracy. It is an effective and robust network traffic forecasting method.

AB  - Social networks and discussion boards have become significant outlets for people to communicate and freely express their opinions. Although the social networks themselves are usually well-provisioned, the participating users frequently point to external links in order to substantiate their discussions. Unfortunately, the heavy traffic load suddenly imposed on these externally linked websites makes them unresponsive, leading to the “flash crowd effect.” Flash crowds present a real challenge as their intensity and occurrence times are impossible to predict. Moreover, most present-day web hosting servers and caching systems, although increasingly capable, are designed to handle a nominal load of requests before they become unresponsive due to limited bandwidth or the processing power allocated to the hosting site. In this paper, we quantify the prevalence of flash crowd events for a popular social discussion board (Digg). Using PlanetLab, we measured the response times of 1,289 unique popular websites and verified that 89 % of the popular URLs suffered variations in their response times. In an effort to identify flash crowds in advance, we evaluated and compared traffic forecasting mechanisms. We showed that predicting network traffic using network measurements has very limited success and cannot be used for large-scale prediction. However, by analyzing the content and structure of social discussions, we were able to accurately forecast popularity for 86 % of the websites within 5 min of a story’s submission and for 95 % of the sites when more social content (5 h worth) became available. Our work indicates that we can effectively leverage social activity to forecast network events when it would otherwise be infeasible to anticipate them. © 2012, Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This paper assesses the toll road concession program started by the federal government of Brazil, from its beginning in 1996 until 2012. Brazil has one of the longest road networks, under private concessions, in the entire world. The authors use the case study approach, based on the available information, to analyze the evolution of the program over the course of its history. Specifically, a detailed analysis is conducted from three perspectives: those of the competitiveness of the tender, the impact of toll modifications caused by the rebalancing of the economics of the contract, and the actual evolution of the traffic flows as compared to their estimates, respectively. It is found that the most recent auctions have been very competitive. Moreover, with the original toll roads, bidders relied on early traffic forecasts that turned out to be overly optimistic, and over the years, contract rebalancing has led to large increases in toll rates. Overall, and even though Brazil's program can be considered successful in many ways, there is still considerable room for improvement. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Based on wavelet transform and chaos algorithm, this paper presents a Network Traffic Forecasting Combination Model. The model introduces chaos algorithm for training the BP network and optimizing weights so as to avoid gradient descent algorithm that slowly converges and likely obtains local optimum results. Before forecasting, we first perform wavelet decomposition on the pretreated flow. Then, we utilize the FARIMA model and the improved Elman neural network model to forecast according to approximate components and detailed components, respectively. At last, we use the combination model for the network traffic forecasting.

AB  - A new methodology is proposed to address issues of networkwide effects of highway projects and interdependencies ofjointly implementing multiple projects to support optimal investment decisions. Specifically, a multicommodity minimum cost network (MMCN) model is introduced to help obtain link-based traffic volumes, vehicle compositions, and speeds for ahighway network that could be used for project benefit estimation using life cycle cost analysis approaches. A hypergraph knapsack model is formulated to identify the best subcollection of interdependent projects to achieve maximized overall benefits for a given budget level. A computational study is conducted using the proposed methodology for tollway capital investment decision making. It is revealed that the overall project benefits with risk and uncertainty considerationsfor facility construction and treatment costs, traffic forecasts, and the discount rate are significantly lower than theestimated project benefits without risk and uncertainty considerations. In addition, project interdependencies are foundto exist for all joint project implementation scenarios. With the continuing growth of budget levels, the overall benefits of projects selected for implementation using the hypergraph knapsack could reach a maximum, beyond which no extra benefits could be obtained. The methodology may be adopted by state and local transportation agencies and metropolitan planning organizations to enhance investment decisions © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The accurate short-term traffic flow forecasting is fundamental to both theoretical and empirical aspects of intelligent transportation systems deployment. This study aimed to develop a simple and effective hybrid model for forecasting traffic volume that combines the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Genetic Programming (GP) models. By combining different models, different aspects of the underlying patterns of traffic flow could be captured. The ARIMA model was used to model the linear component of the traffic flow time series. Then the GP model was applied to capture the nonlinear component by modelling the residuals from the ARIMA model. The hybrid models were fitted for four different time-aggregations: 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. The validations of the proposed hybrid methodology were performed by using traffic data under both typical and atypical conditions from multiple locations on the I-880N freeway in the United States. The results indicated that the hybrid models had better predictive performance than utilizing only ARIMA model for different aggregation time intervals under typical conditions. The Mean Relative Error (MRE) of the hybrid models was found to be from 4.1 to 6.9% for different aggregation time intervals under typical conditions. The predictive performance of the hybrid method was improved with an increase in the aggregation time interval. In addition, the validation results showed that the predictive performance of the hybrid model was also better than that of the ARIMA model under atypical conditions. © 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - It is important and also challenging to plan airport facilities to meet future traffic needs in a rapidly changing environment, which is characterized by various uncertainties. One key issue in airport facility development is that facility performance functions (delay levels as functions of capacity utilization rates) are nonlinear, which complicates the solution method design. Potential demand fluctuations in a deregulated aviation market add another dimension to the decision making process. To solve this problem, a deterministic total cost minimization model is proposed and then extended into stochastic programs, by including uncertainties in traffic forecasts. After the exploration of properties of the delay cost function, an Outer-Approximation (OA) technique which is superior to the existing discrete approximation is designed. After model enhancements, an efficient solution framework based on the OA technique is used to solve the model to its global optimality by interactively generating upper and lower bounds to the objective. Computational tests demonstrate the validity of developed models and efficiency of proposed algorithms. The total cost is reduced by 18.8% with the stochastic program in the numerical example. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Statistical traffic data analysis is a hot topic in traffic management and control. In this field, current research progresses focus on analysing traffic flows of individual links or local regions in a transportation network. Less attention are paid to the global view of traffic states over the entire network, which is important for modelling large-scale traffic scenes. Our aim is precisely to propose a new methodology for extracting spatiotemporal traffic patterns, ultimately for modelling large-scale traffic dynamics, and long-term traffic forecasting. The authors attack this issue by utilising localitypreserving non-negative matrix factorisation (LPNMF) to derive low-dimensional representation of network-level traffic states. Clustering is performed on the compact LPNMF projections to unveil typical spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of network-level traffic states. The authors have tested the proposed method on simulated traffic data generated for a large-scale road network, and reported experimental results validate the ability of our approach for extracting meaningful large-scale space-time traffic patterns. Furthermore, the derived clustering results provide an intuitive understanding of spatial-temporal characteristics of traffic flows in the large-scale network and a basis for potential longterm forecasting. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.

AB  - The accuracy of traffic forecasting is a point of considerable importance to the effective allocation of limited resources. Thus, reasonable and accurate forecasting methods should be developed to help engineers and planners make rational decisions and reduce probable associated risks. This study investigated the performance of three forecasting methods: aggregate regression, disaggregate trend and empirical Bayesian analysis. To accomplish this objective, traffic volumes for major rural roads in 1996 through 2004 were obtained from the Ministry of Public Works and Housing of Jordan. For each city or zone, cross-sectional data on socio-economic and demographic variables were collected. Multivariate regression analysis was carried out to develop mathematical relationships that could have practical applications. The results indicated that the products of populations-to-roadway length ratio, number of employees, fuel consumption, number of buildings and road type significantly influenced traffic interchange between cities or zones. For Jordan conditions, the linear model was recommended. Trend models, having exponential form, were also developed. Performance analysis indicated that aggregate regression and empirical Bayesian analysis provided comparable results. In contrast, the performance of trend method was considered to be poor. Finally, while these results are related to Jordan, they possibly apply elsewhere as well. © 2014 JUST. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This study reviews the 50-year history of travel demand forecasting models, concentrating on their accuracy and relevance for public decision-making. Only a few studies of model accuracy have been performed, but they find that the likely inaccuracy in the 20-year forecast of major road projects is ±30 % at minimum, with some estimates as high as ±40-50 % over even shorter time horizons. There is a significant tendency to over-estimate traffic and underestimate costs, particularly for toll roads. Forecasts of transit costs and ridership are even more uncertain and also significantly optimistic. The greatest knowledge gap in US travel demand modeling is the unknown accuracy of US urban road traffic forecasts. Modeling weaknesses leading to these problems (non-behavioral content, inaccuracy of inputs and key assumptions, policy insensitivity, and excessive complexity) are identified. In addition, the institutional and political environments that encourage optimism bias and low risk assessment in forecasts are also reviewed. Major institutional factors, particularly low local funding matches and competitive grants, confound scenario modeling efforts and dampen the hope that technical modeling improvements alone can improve forecasting accuracy. The fundamental problems are not technical but institutional: high non-local funding shares for large projects warp local perceptions of project benefit versus costs, leading to both input errors and political pressure to fund projects. To deal with these issues, the paper outlines two different approaches. The first, termed 'hubris', proposes a multi-decade effort to substantially improve model forecasting accuracy over time by monitoring performance and improving data, methods and understanding of travel, but also by deliberately modifying the institutional arrangements that lead to optimism bias. The second, termed 'humility', proposes to openly quantify and recognize the inherent uncertainty in travel demand forecasts and deliberately reduce their influence on project decision-making. However to be successful either approach would require monitoring and reporting accuracy, standards for modeling and forecasting, greater model transparency, educational initiatives, coordinated research, strengthened ethics and reduction of non-local funding ratios so that localities have more at stake. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The literature on short-term traffic flow forecasting has undergone great development recently. Many works, describing a wide variety of different approaches, which very often share similar features and ideas, have been published. However, publications presenting new prediction algorithms usually employ different settings, data sets, and performance measurements, making it difficult to infer a clear picture of the advantages and limitations of each model. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we review existing approaches to short-term traffic flow forecasting methods under the common view of probabilistic graphical models, presenting an extensive experimental comparison, which proposes a common baseline for their performance analysis and provides the infrastructure to operate on a publicly available data set. Second, we present two new support vector regression models, which are specifically devised to benefit from typical traffic flow seasonality and are shown to represent an interesting compromise between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. The SARIMA model coupled with a Kalman filter is the most accurate model; however, the proposed seasonal support vector regressor turns out to be highly competitive when performing forecasts during the most congested periods. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Energy efficiency and resilience are two well established research topics in optical transport networks. However, their overall objectives (i.e., power minimization and resource utilization/ availability maximization) conflict. In fact, provisioning schemes optimized for best resilience performance are in most cases not energy-efficient in their operations, and vice versa. However, very few works in the literature consider the interesting issues that may arise when energy efficiency and resilience are combined in the same networking solution. The objective of this article is to identify a number of research challenges and trade-offs for the design of energy-efficient and resilient optical transport networks from the perspective of long-term traffic forecasts, short-term traffic dynamics, and service level agreement requirements. We support the challenges with justifying numbers based on lessons learned from our previous work. The article also discusses suitable metrics for energy efficiency and resilience evaluation, in addition to a number of steps that need to be taken at the standardization level to incorporate energy efficiency into already existing and well established protocols. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Probabilistic models describing macroscopic traffic flow have proven useful both in practice and in theory. In theoretical investigations of wide-scatter in flow-density data, the statistical features of flow density relations have played a central role. In real-time estimation and traffic forecasting applications, probabilistic extensions of macroscopic relations are widely used. However, how to obtain such relations, in a manner that results in physically reasonable behavior has not been addressed. This paper presents the derivation of probabilistic macroscopic traffic flow relations from Newell's simplified car-following model. The probabilistic nature of the model allows for investigating the impact of driver heterogeneity on macroscopic relations of traffic flow. The physical features of the model are verified analytically and shown to produce behavior which is consistent with well-established traffic flow principles. An empirical investigation is carried out using trajectory data from the New Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) program and the model's ability to reproduce real-world traffic data is validated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Outliers in traffic flow series represent uncommon events occurring in the roadway systems and outlier detection and investigation will help to unravel the mechanism of such events. However, studies on outlier detection and investigations are fairly limited in transportation field where a vast volume of traffic condition data has been collected from traffic monitoring devices installed in many roadway systems. Based on an online algorithm that has the ability of jointly predict the level and the conditional variance of the traffic flow series, a real time outlier detection method is proposed and implemented. Using real world data collected from four regions in both the United States and the United Kingdom, it was found that outliers can be detected using the proposed detection strategy. In addition, through a comparative experimental study, it was shown that the information contained in the outliers should be assimilated into the forecasting system to enhance its ability of adapting to the changing patterns of the traffic flow series. Moreover, the investigation into the effects of outliers on the forecasting system structure showed a significant connection between the outliers and the forecasting system parameters changes. General conclusions are provided concerning the analyses with future work recommended to investigate the underlying outlier generating mechanism and outlier treatment strategy in transportation applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study compares the performance of statistical and Bayesian combination models with classical single time series models for short-term traffic forecasting. Combinations are based on fractionally integrated autoregressive time series models of travel speed with exogenous variables that consider speed's spatio-temporal evolution, and volume and weather conditions. Several statistical hypotheses on the effectiveness of combinations compared to the single models are also tested. Results show that, in the specific application, linear regression combination techniques may provide more accurate forecasts than Bayesian combination models. Moreover, combining models with different degrees of spatio-temporal complexity and exogeneities is most likely to be the best choice in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the risk of combining forecasts is lower than the risk of choosing a single model with increased spatio-temporal complexity. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology

AB  - This paper is concerned with long-term (20+ years) forecasting of broadband traffic in next-generation networks. Such long-term approach requires going beyond extrapolations of past traffic data while facing high uncertainty in predicting the future developments and facing the fact that, in 20 years, the current network technologies and architectures will be obsolete. Thus, “order of magnitude” upper bounds of upstream and downstream traffic are deemed to be good enough to facilitate such long-term forecasting. These bounds can be obtained by evaluating the limits of human sighting and assuming that these limits will be achieved by future services or, alternatively, by considering the contents transferred by bandwidth-demanding applications such as those using embedded interactive 3D video streaming. The traffic upper bounds are a good indication of the peak values and, subsequently, also of the future network capacity demands. Furthermore, the main drivers of traffic growth including multimedia as well as non-multimedia applications are identified. New disruptive applications and services are explored that can make good use of the large bandwidth provided by next-generation networks. The results can be used to identify monetization opportunities of future services and to map potential revenues for network operators. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - Since the mobile boom has started to cause a traffic jam in mobile broadband networks, forecasts on future traffic needs are urgent information for the provision of high-quality mobile broadband services. Thus, this research aims to forecast mobile broadband traffic, focusing on the Korean case. With the emergence of diverse classes of services, where the available devices for the services and their patterns of use are changing rapidly, most of the existing forecasting methods may not be applicable. Therefore, this study designed a new methodology for traffic forecasts, a device-based forecasting that consider mobile traffic from various devices for mobile services. The proposed approach performs the three-round Delphi process to complement the experts' opinions in forecasting mobile traffic for 10 years. In particular, scenario analysis was applied to reflect uncertainty of future dynamic situations, investigating optimistic, neutral and pessimistic scenarios. In addition, the forecasting performance of the suggested approach was validated by comparing it with that of traditional forecasting tools. The research findings indicate that mobile traffic will increase rapidly, and the patterns of use for mobile devices will change to some extent, which will provide strategic implications for both companies and government. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transportation modelers are frequently faced with several optimization challenges related to model selection and parameter optimization for forecasting. The concept of surrogate modeling is discussed in order to tackle some limitations related to the practice of developing short-term forecasting algorithms. An automated meta-modeling technique is presented that uses heterogeneous information from multiple types of statistical and computationally intelligent models, along with multi-objective evolutionary strategies to optimize the model and parameter selection. A number of different models from the family of Support Vector Machines, Radial Base Functions and Neural Networks are jointly considered and optimized with the aim to improve the short-term predictability of travel speed. Results are presented and discussed in both a univariate and multivariate framework. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Accurate forecasting of traffic demand is one of the most important issues in the feasibility study on highway projects. The existing traffic forecasting models, to some extent, have the problem of limited accuracy. In this study, two widely used methods which are Elastic Coefficient Method (ECM) and Motorized Travel Frequency Method (MTFM) were comprehensively applied to forecast the traffic volume in Kigali, Rwanda. And Comparative analysis was made between the forecasting result and the actual survey traffic result in the project's future years. Compared with the actual survey result, the predicted result of ECM is larger and relative error is 10.49%. The result of MTFM is smaller and relative error is -7.11%. While the weighted average of above methods is closer to the actual result with a relative error in the interval of -5.00 to 5.00%. The research has shown that the combined forecast method proposed in this study, which can make up the defects in accuracy of single model, is easy to operate and owns more accuracy in traffic prediction. This study has suggested that proper combination of several methods would be an advisable trend for the traffic demand forecasting. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.

AB  - Rural roads represent an important part of the economy in the Great Plains and Midwest of the United States. As oil exploration in North Dakota increases, the number of vehicles travelling on these roads is also increasing, resulting in significant needs for infrastructure maintenance and upgrades, including the construction of new bridges. The lifecycle benefit–cost analysis of bridge construction is the overall objective of this research. This paper investigates the benefits of combining travel demand modeling and lifecycle benefit–cost analysis, and demonstrates traffic forecasting using geographic information systems (GIS) and network flow problem. The paper also shows a comparison of the alternative scenarios. The authors demonstrate a method of integrating geographic information systems, operations research, and data analytics to estimate future traffic by evaluating infrastructure needs. The travel demand modeling is essential for the lifecycle benefit–cost analysis. This study would help government agencies and construction companies evaluate and prioritize new bridge construction projects. The agencies should consider adding the environmental costs. © 2016 by the authors

AB  - Predictions of fundamental traffic variables in the short-term or near-term future are vital for any successful dynamic traffic management application. Univariate short-term traffic flow prediction algorithms are popular in literature. However, to facilitate the operationalities of advanced adaptive traffic management systems, there is a necessity of developing multivariate traffic condition prediction algorithms. A new multivariate short-term traffic flow and speed prediction methodology is proposed in this paper where the traffic flow and speed observations from uncongested (or linear) and congested (or nonlinear) regimes are regime-adjusted to ensure consistent system dynamics. The prediction methodology is developed by using artificial neural networks (ANN) algorithms in conjunction with adaptive learning rules. These learning rules demonstrate significantly improved accuracy and simultaneous reduction in computation times. Additionally, the paper attempts to identify the most suitable adaptive learning rule from a chosen pool of rules. The validation of the prediction methodology is performed by using traffic data from multiple locations in the United Kingdom (U.K.). The results indicate that the proposed multivariate forecasting algorithm is effective and computationally parsimonious to simultaneously predict traffic flow and speed in freeway or highway networks. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This paper is concerned with forecasting traffic accidents at a relatively aggregate level and over a long time period; the sort of information that is required as part of a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of a major transportation investment or policy change. It is not so focused on appraising the social value of specific safety measures, although some of the points made seem germane. Whereas there has been much ex ante analysis at the meso- and macro-levels looking at the causes of accidents and ways of reducing both their number and severity, much less ex post has been done considering the accuracy of predictions of accident rates after an investment or policy initiative. Given the evidence that exists on the accuracy of traffic forecasts, especially involving oft over-optimistic predictions of public transit and rail use, there is at least a prima facie case for arguing that many investment and policy decisions are being based, in part, on over favorable assumptions with regard to their aggregate safety impacts. © 2014 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the traffic information forecasting based on the data mining technology. As well known, useful knowledge in traffic management system often hides in a large amount of traffic data. Generally, prior data pattern labels have been used to train the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to identify the traffic conditions in the traffic information forecasting. The performance of the ANN models suffers from the prior information of the experts. To relieve this impact in the traffic information forecasting, a new ANN model is proposed based on the data mining technology in this study. The Self-Organized Feature Map (SOFM) is firstly employed to cluster the traffic data through an unsupervised learning and provide the labels for these data. Then the labeled data were used to train the GA-Chaos optimized RBF neural network. Herein, the GA-Chaos algorithm is used to train the RBF parameters. Experimental tests use practical data sets from the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) were implemented to validate the performance of the proposed ANN model. The analyses results demonstrate that the proposed method can extract the potential patterns hidden in the traffic data and can accurately predict the future traffic state. The prediction accuracy is beyond 95%. Hence, the new data mining model can provide practical application for traffic information forecasting in the ITS system. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.

Paper presents results of multidirectional study attempting to serve urban traffic without the need to erect noise barriers interfering urban space. Initial concept of the road expansion included construction of 1000 m of noise barriers dividing city space. Improvement in the acoustic conditions after construction completion is possible due to the applied noise protection measures: vehicle speed limit, smooth of traffic flow, use of road pavement of reduced noise emission and the technical improvement of the tramway. © 2016 Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - This work analyzes the impact of volume-delay function inputs and parameters on the uncertainty of a four-step model traffic forecasts by link and identifies the relevant major error contributors. For that different specifications of the volume-delay function (including its choice and parameters probability distribution) and road capacity as an uncertain element of the input are considered. The uncertainty is expressed in form of variance of the link flows forecast provided by the model for different links types. To illustrate the analyses, a case study data from Aveiro, a medium sized city in Portugal, is used. The results suggest that the capacity variation has higher impact on the final uncertainty (up to 6 % of the coefficient of variation in average for all types of links) than the volume-delay function parameters (up to 3 % of the coefficient of variation) and the links with lower speed limits are affected most. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - In this paper, we present our effort towards comprehensive traffic forecasting for big data applications using external, light-weighted file system monitoring. Our idea is motivated by the key observations that rich traffic demand information already exists in the log and meta-data files of many big data applications, and that such information can be readily extracted through run-time file system monitoring. As the first step, we use Hadoop as a concrete example to explore our methodology and develop a system called HadoopWatch to predict traffic demands of Hadoop applications. We further implement HadoopWatch in a small-scale testbed with 10 physical servers and 30 virtual machines. Our experiments over a series of MapReduce applications demonstrate that HadoopWatch can forecast the traffic demand with almost 100% accuracy and time advance. Furthermore, it makes no modification on the Hadoop framework, and introduces little overhead to the application performance. Finally, to showcase the utility of accurate traffic prediction made by HadoopWatch, we design and implement a simple HadoopWatch-enabled network optimization module into the HadoopWatch controller, and with realistic Hadoop job benchmarks we find that even a simple algorithm can leverage the forecasting results provided by HadoopWatch to significantly improve the Hadoop job completion time by up to 14.72%. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The article presents the research results of economic feasibility of trains' breaking-up order control at marshalling yards. The article objective was to determine the area of rational use of trains' breaking-up order model, formalized in the form of stochastic programming problem. As a effectiveness criterion of trains' breaking-up order operating costs of marshalling yard were used, including the costs associated with cars' and locomotives' dwell time on the station and its approaches, as well as costs associated with additional shunting work. With the help of simulation modeling the dependence was obtained, describing the impact of trains' arrival forecasting error and processed car volumes on reducing operating costs of the marshalling yards through the trains' breaking-up order control. The studies enable us to establish the requirements for the accuracy of information support of operational planning tasks, which is necessary to achieve the desired economic effect of the trains' breaking-up order control. © 2017, Silesian University of Technology.

AB  - The ability to timely and accurately forecast the evolution of traffic is very important in traffic management and control applications. This paper proposes a non-parametric and data-driven methodology for short-term traffic forecasting based on identifying similar traffic patterns using an enhanced K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithm. Weighted Euclidean distance, which gives more weight to recent measurements, is used as a similarity measure for K-NN. Moreover, winsorization of the neighbors is implemented to dampen the effects of dominant candidates, and rank exponent is used to aggregate the candidate values. Robustness of the proposed method is demonstrated by implementing it on large datasets collected from different regions and by comparing it with advanced time series models, such as SARIMA and adaptive Kalman Filter models proposed by others. It is demonstrated that the proposed method reduces the mean absolute percent error by more than 25%. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed enhanced K-NN algorithm is evaluated for multiple forecast steps and also its performance is tested under data with missing values. This research provides strong evidence suggesting that the proposed non-parametric and data-driven approach for short-term traffic forecasting provides promising results. Given the simplicity, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed approach, it can be easily incorporated with real-time traffic control for proactive freeway traffic management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Long-term traffic forecasting has become a basic and critical work in the research on road traffic congestion. It plays an important role in alleviating road traffic congestion and improving traffic management quality. According to the problem that long-term traffic forecasting is short of systematic and effective methods, a long-term traffic situation forecasting model is proposed in this article based on functional nonparametric regression. In the functional nonparametric regression framework, autocorrelation analysis (ACF) is introduced to analyze the autocorrelation coefficient of traffic flow for selecting the state vector, and the functional principal component analysis is also used as distance function for computing proximities between different traffic flow time series. The experiments based on the traffic flow data in Beijing expressway prove that the functional nonparametric regression model outperforms forecast methods in accuracy and effectiveness. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Recent estimates indicate that by 2017 the number of mobile devices per capita will be increased to 1.4 billion, as reported by the Cisco Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast 2013 Update. This increase has led to the strong emergence of mobile learning in many institutions and countries. However, although several studies concerning Usability Evaluation Methods have been reported, there is scarcity of the systematic review that has been published in the field on Mobile Apps, in particular Mobile Learning Apps (MLA). Therefore, this article aims to review the current information on Usability Evaluation Methods (UEMs) that have been used by many researchers and practitioner to evaluate Mobile Applications in general, and specifically in the Mobile Learning Application. The review focuses on articles published between 2010 and 2015. A systematic review was performed to answer the main research questions. The researchers found the Expertise, Focus Group, Interview, Observation, Questionnaire and Thinking Aloud commonly use in Mobile Application Studies. While, this study found the Interview, Observation and Questionnaire more popular in the mobile learning application. This study provides an overview of current and most popular UEMs to the evaluators and developers. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - The introduction of new services requiring large and dynamic bitrate connectivity can cause changes in the direction of the traffic in metro and even core network segments throughout the day. This leads to large overprovisioning in statically managed virtual network topologies (VNTs), which are designed to cope with the traffic forecast. To reduce expenses while ensuring the required grade of service, in this paper we propose a VNT reconfiguration approach based on data analytics for traffic prediction (VENTURE). It regularly reconfigures the VNT based on the predicted traffic, thus adapting the topology to both the current and the predicted traffic volume and direction. A machine learning algorithm based on an artificial neural network is used to provide robust and adaptive traffic models. The reconfiguration problem that takes as its input the traffic prediction is modeled mathematically, and a heuristic is proposed to solve it in practical times. To support VENTURE, we propose an architecture that allows collecting and storing data from monitoring at the routers and that is used to train predictive models for every origin-destination pair. Exhaustive simulation results of the algorithm, together with the experimental assessment of the proposed architecture, are finally presented. © 2017 Optical Society of America.

AB  - Reasonable parking charge and supply policy are essential for the regular operation of the traffic in city center. This paper develops an evaluation model for parking policies using system dynamics. A quantitative study is conducted to examine the effects of parking charge and supply policy on traffic speed. The model, which is composed of three interrelated subsystems, first summarizes the travel cost of each travel mode and then calibrates the travel choice model through the travel mode subsystem. Finally, the subsystem that evaluates the state of traffic forecasts future car speed based on bureau of public roads (BPR) function and generates new travel cost until the entire model reaches a steady state. The accuracy of the model is verified in Hangzhou Wulin business district. The related error of predicted speed is only 2.2%. The results indicate that the regular pattern of traffic speed and parking charge can be illustrated using the proposed model based on system dynamics, and the model infers that reducing the parking supply in core area will increase its congestion level and, under certain parking supply conditions, there exists an interval of possible pricing at which the service reaches a level that is fairly stable. © 2017 Zhenyu Mei et al.

AB  - The value of travel time savings (VTTS) is used as input in traffic forecasting models and cost-benefit analyses, and it is typically estimated in stated choice studies in which preferences are derived. However, preferences are affected by the recollection of prior experience, and evidence suggests that the recollection of an event is different than the actual experience. Although the choice of interview location is likely to affect how long it has been since the respondents travelled, evidence is somewhat limited on the influence of interview location on VTTS. This paper investigates the role that interview location plays in the VTTS of ferry travellers. We find that the mean value of headway time savings is significantly higher among respondents interviewed onboard ferries than among those interviewed at home. The mean value of onboard time savings is significantly lower among those interviewed onboard the ferries than among those interviewed at home. Failure to take into account the influence of interview location might lead to biased estimates. To the extent that such biased estimates are used in cost-benefit analyses, this bias will affect the calculated welfare effects of changes in frequency and speed on scheduled passenger transport, resulting in suboptimal allocation of public resources. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Combined with Fourier spectrum prior knowledge, a novel wavelet multiresolution analysis and forecasting algorithm is proposed. It focuses on long term trend prediction of multi-periodic, non-stationary, mobile communication traffic series. New algorithm calculates the Fourier spectrum for multi-periodic series at first, and takes the prominent period components with definite physical notion as the prior knowledge. After that, it extracts more valuable time domain features with wavelet multiresolution analysis. Finally, it adopts a single model to predict each of them, and integrates the prediction results to gain the final trend prediction of traffic time series. Experimental results on real traffic data show that all isolated components in proposed multiresolution analysis deliver the distinct physical information in traffic data. Additionally, our algorithm can pick out most of prominent period components revealed in the Fourier spectrum and improve prediction accuracy.

AB  - Traffic flow is widely recognized as an important parameter for road traffic state forecasting. Fuzzy state transform and Kalman filter (KF) have been applied in this field separately. But the studies show that the former method has good performance on the trend forecasting of traffic state variation but always involves several numerical errors. The latter model is good at numerical forecasting but is deficient in the expression of time hysteretically. This paper proposed an approach that combining fuzzy state transform and KF forecasting model. In considering the advantage of the two models, a weight combination model is proposed. The minimum of the sum forecasting error squared is regarded as a goal in optimizing the combined weight dynamically. Real detection data are used to test the efficiency. Results indicate that the method has a good performance in terms of short-term traffic forecasting. © 2015 Deng Ming-jun and Qu Shi-ru.

AB  - To improve the predictive accuracy of network traffic, as for the training sample selection, this paper proposes a FCM-LSSVM for training sample selection. Firstly, fuzzy-means clustering algorithm is used to make cluster analysis of network filling data to eliminate the isolated sample points in it and to build training set of LSSVM, and then the training set is input to the LSSVM for learning. Furthermore, Artificial Bee Colony is used to optimize model parameters, and finally, network traffic forecasting model is established, and the simulation experiment is employed to test the performance of the model. Simulation results show that compared to other network traffic forecasting models, FCM-LSSVM not only improves the prediction accuracy of network traffic, and increases modeling speed, getting more desirable forecasted results of network traffic.

AB  - Understanding and forecasting mobile traffic of large scale cellular networks is extremely valuable for service providers to control and manage the explosive mobile data, such as network planning, load balancing, and data pricing mechanisms. This paper targets at extracting and modeling traffic patterns of 9,000 cellular towers deployed in a metropolitan city. To achieve this goal, we design, implement, and evaluate a time series analysis approach that is able to decompose large scale mobile traffic into regularity and randomness components. Then, we use time series prediction to forecast the traffic patterns based on the regularity components. Our study verifies the effectiveness of our utilized time series decomposition method, and shows the geographical distribution of the regularity and randomness component. Moreover, we reveal that high predictability of the regularity component can be achieved, and demonstrate that the prediction of randomness component of mobile traffic data is impossible. © 2016 IEEE.

In literature, many hybrids of auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) models are devised for the TSD prediction. These hybrid models consider such TSD as a combination of linear and non-linear components, apply combination of ARIMA and ANN in some manner, to obtain the predictions. Out of the many available hybrid ARIMA-ANN models, this paper investigates as to which of them suits better for Internet traffic data. This suitability of hybrid ARIMA-ANN models is studied for both one-step ahead and multistep ahead prediction cases. For the purpose of the study, Internet traffic data is sampled at every 30 and 60 minutes. Model performances are evaluated using the mean absolute error and mean square error measurement. For one-step ahead prediction, with a forecast horizon of 10 points and for three-step prediction, with a forecast horizon of 12 points, the moving average filter based hybrid ARIMA-ANN model gave better forecast accuracy than the other compared models.

AB  - For the purpose of projecting future macroscopic Internet traffic, we have analyzed historical U.S. and global Internet traffic volumes previously reported for 1990 to the present. The empirical long-term traffic trends are characterized by growth rates that have generally been decreasing over time, and so are not adequately described as exponential growth. Based on regression analyses, we also conclude that the decreasing growth rates are not well represented by the saturation characteristic of the logistic function alone. However, we find the observed traffic data are well reproduced over ranges spanning more than six orders of magnitude of traffic volume and a period of 17 years by a hyperbolic dependence of the compound annual growth rate on time. Using a semi-empirical hyperbolic function to model the growth rate we have carried out linearized regression analyses of a combination of historical and near-term traffic forecasts to project macroscopic Internet traffic to 2020 for several geo-economic regions, market segments, and application categories. In contrast to the decade of 2000-2010 when global Internet traffic grew more than 100-fold, the projections indicate that over the decade 2010-2020 the global wireline Internet traffic will grow approximately 16 times larger to approach 250 exabytes per month and the global mobile Internet traffic will grow approximately 150 times larger to approach 40 exabytes per month. The projections also indicate that over the decade the compound annual growth rate of global wireline Internet traffic will decrease from approximately 45 percent to 25 percent per year and the growth rate of global mobility Internet traffic will decrease from approximately 170 percent to 30 percent per year. By considering both the historical trends and near-term forecasts, our analyses and projections call attention to those traffic categories for which estimates of future Internet traffic may carry lesser or greater uncertainty. © 2013 Alcatel-Lucent.

AB  - Recent advancements in sensor, mobile computing, and wireless communication technologies have created an opportunity for mobile computing and online traffic simulations. This paper presents a distributed traffic simulation framework where traffic simulation and data processing are performed in a distributed fashion by mobile computing. In this framework, communication middleware and traffic simulation are integrated to manage the distributed network to synchronize traffic predictions among logical processes using a rollback-based optimistic synchronization protocol. The traffic predictions across the multiple logical processes are coordinated by optimistic execution inspired by Time Warp which mitigates the synchronization problem allowing each logical process to execute asynchronously. Invalidated estimates are updated quickly by this mechanism to ensure more robust and reliable estimates. This framework allows each mobile computing based in-vehicle simulation to model a small portion of the overall network and provide detailed traffic state information. Such a system could provide both more up-to-date and robust predictions than that offered by centralized simulations within a single transportation management center. As these systems evolve, the mobile computing online traffic predictions can be used in surface transportation management and travelers will benefit from more accurate and reliable traffic forecast. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Climate change is a prevalent issue facing the world today. Unexpected increase in rainfall intensity and events is one of the major signatures of climate change. Rainfall influences traffic conditions and, in turn, traffic volume in urban arterials. For improved traffic management under adverse weather conditions, it is important to develop a traffic prediction algorithm considering the effect of rainfall. This inclusion is not intuitive as the effect is not immediate, and the influence of rainfall on traffic volume is often unrecognizable in a direct correlation analysis between the two time-series data sets; it can only be observed at certain frequency levels. Accordingly, it is useful to employ a multiresolution prediction framework to develop a weather adaptive traffic forecasting algorithm. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is a well-known multiresolution data analysis methodology. However, DWT imparts time variance in the transformed signal and makes it unsuitable for further time-series analysis. Therefore, the stationary form of DWT known as stationary wavelet transform (SWT) has been used in this paper to develop a neurowavelet prediction algorithm to forecast hourly traffic flow considering the effect of rainfall. The proposed prediction algorithm has been evaluated at two urban arterial locations in Dublin, Ireland. This paper shows that the rainfall data successfully augments the traffic flow data as an exogenous variable in periods of inclement weather, resulting in accurate predictions of future traffic flow at the two chosen locations. The forecasts from the neurowavelet model outperform the forecasts from the standard artificial neural network (ANN) model. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate and reliable forecasting of traffic variables is one of the primary functions of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Reliable systems that are able to forecast traffic conditions accurately, multiple time steps into the future, are required for advanced traveller information systems. However, traffic forecasting is a difficult task because of the nonlinear and nonstationary properties of traffic series. Traditional linear models are incapable of modelling such properties, and typically perform poorly, particularly when conditions differ from the norm. Machine learning approaches such as artificial neural networks, nonparametric regression and kernel methods (KMs) have often been shown to outperform linear models in the literature. A bottleneck of the latter approach is that the information pertaining to all previous traffic states must be contained within the kernel, but the computational complexity of KMs usually scales cubically with the number of data points in the kernel. In this paper, a novel kernel-based machine learning (ML) algorithm is developed, namely the local online kernel ridge regression (LOKRR) model. Exploiting the observation that traffic data exhibits strong cyclic patterns characterised by rush hour traffic, LOKRR makes use of local kernels with varying parameters that are defined around each time point. This approach has 3 advantages over the standard single kernel approach: (1) It allows parameters to vary by time of day, capturing the time varying distribution of traffic data; (2) It allows smaller kernels to be defined that contain only the relevant traffic patterns, and; (3) It is online, allowing new traffic data to be incorporated as it arrives. The model is applied to the forecasting of travel times on London's road network, and is found to outperform three benchmark models in forecasting up to 1. h ahead. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The control of the evolution of road traffic streams is highly related to productivity, safety, sustainability and, even, comfort. Although, nowadays, the findings from research efforts and the development of new technologies enable accurate traffic forecasts in almost any conditions, these calculations are usually limited by the data and the equipment available. Most traffic management centres depend on the data provided, at best, by double-loop detectors. These loops supply time means over different aggregation periods, which are indiscriminately used as the bases for subsequent estimations. Since space mean speeds are those needed in most applications (note the fundamental relationship between flow and density in traffic flow theory), most current practice begins with an error. This paper introduces a simple algorithm that the allows estimation of space mean speeds from the data provided by the loops without the need for any additional financial outlay, as long as the traffic in each time interval of aggregation is stationary and its speed distribution is log-normal. Specifically, it is focused on the calculation of the variance of the speeds with regard to the time mean, thus making possible to use the relationship between time mean speeds and space mean speeds defined by Rakha (2005). The results obtained with real data show that the algorithm behaves well if the calculation conditions help fulfil the initial hypotheses. The primary difficulties arise with transient traffic and, in this case, other specific methodologies should be used. Data fusion seems promising in this regard. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the improvement provided by the algorithm turns out to be highly beneficial both when used alone in the case of stationarity or as a part of a fusion. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Probe vehicle data are being increasingly applied in urban dynamic traffic data collection. However, the mobility and scale limit of probe vehicles may lead to incomplete or inaccurate data and thus influence the measurement of the state of traffic. At present, probe vehicle data are usually repaired by linear interpolation or a historical average method, but the repair accuracy is relatively low. To address the given problems, the multithreshold control repair method (MTCRM) was proposed to clean and repair the probe vehicle data. The MTCRM adopts threshold control and a rule based on the approximate normalization transform to clean abnormal traffic data and to fill in the missing data by a weighted average method and an exponential smoothing method. In this approach, we combine topological road network characteristics to fill in the missing data from data for neighboring road sections and repair noisy data by reconstructing the principal components. This paper mainly focuses on analyzing the component of the recurring pattern of probe vehicle data, which can provide guidelines for the subsequent traffic forecasts. The findings of data repair for different grades of road in Beijing, China, demonstrate that the mean repair error may meet the requirements of traffic-state measurement, demonstrating that MTCRM can effectively clean probe vehicle data. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - There is a need to match emission estimations accuracy with the outputs of transport models. The overall error rate in long-term traffic forecasts resulting from strategic transport models is likely to be significant. Microsimulation models, whilst high-resolution in nature, may have similar measurement errors if they use the outputs of strategic models to obtain traffic demand predictions. At the microlevel, this paper discusses the limitations of existing emissions estimation approaches. Emission models for predicting emission pollutants other than COare proposed. A genetic algorithm approach is adopted to select the predicting variables for the black box model. The approach is capable of solving combinatorial optimization problems. Overall, the emission prediction results reveal that the proposed new models outperform conventional equations in terms of accuracy and robustness. © 2015 Sicong Zhu et al.

AB  - The advances in sensor technologies enable real-time collection of high-fidelity spatiotemporal data on transportation networks of major cities. In this paper, using two real-world transportation datasets: (1) incident and (2) traffic data, we address the problem of predicting and quantifying the impact of traffic incidents. Traffic incidents include any nonrecurring events on road networks, such as accidents, weather hazard or road construction. By analyzing archived incident data, we classify incidents based on their features (e.g., time, location, type of incident). Subsequently, we model the impact of each incident class on its surrounding traffic by analyzing the archived traffic data at the time and location of the incidents. Consequently, in real-time, if we observe a similar incident (from real-time incident feeds), we predict and quantify its impact on the surrounding traffic using our models. This information, in turn, can help drivers to effectively avoid impacted areas in real-time. To be useful for such real-time navigation application, and unlike current approaches, we study the dynamic behavior of incidents and model the impact as a quantitative time varying spatial span. In addition, we study a novel approach that improves our classification method by analyzing traffic density around the incident area and the initial behavior of the incident. We evaluated our approach with very large traffic and incident datasets collected from Los Angeles County and the results show by utilizing our impact prediction approach in the navigation system, precision of the travel time calculation can be improved by up to 67 %. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - Urban transportation is closely related to the growth of urban economy, urban function layout, and people’s life trip. However, with the development of the city, transportation problemsare becoming more and more important. The development of information technology provides traditional transportation withnew opportunities to solve the old problems using the new platform. Intelligent transportation is a new generation of transportation system that can solve the urban traffic congestion and build a comprehensive transportation system, so as to achieve the intelligent transportation infrastructure and promote the sustainable development of the transportation industry. Data information sharing is realized by using big data technology, which contributes to the establishment of a comprehensive three-dimensional traffic information system. In addition, itis also of great help to enhance the level of traffic forecast. However, there are many problems in the collection, storage, and use of intelligent transportation. Large data traffic system need to deal with a large number of non-structured data and semi-structured data. At the same time, the capacity of the data becomes bigger. The data grow faster, and the format of the data becomes more complicated. Methods and structures of traditional data storage are unable to meet the needs of the construction of intelligent transportation network. In this paper, the data storage system is redesigned to serve the construction of intelligent transportation network. Firstly, some algorithms and structures of NoSQL are optimized. Secondly, the function of NoSQL is extended, so that it can store structured data. At the end of this paper, the storage system is verified by experiments. Experiments show that the storage system proposed in this paper is feasible, and it can provide effective data storage solutions for the construction of intelligent transportation network. © 2016, Aracne Ed.

AB  - This paper presents an applied computation tool for coordinating various airport facility expansions and gives explicit consideration of the impacts of various uncertainties. An airport is modeled as a system consisting of components (e.g., runways, air cargo terminals, and maintenance facilities) that operate in series or in parallel. To balance (i.e., equalize) roughly the capacities of the components acting in series, the paper proposes a network flow formulation in which interactions between user flows and facilities are modeled. In addition to the uncertainty in air traffic forecasts, the effect of an uncertain aircraft mix is also considered. The final model is a stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program that is converted to its deterministic equivalent because the number of stochastic scenarios is finite. An interactive solution framework is proposed to solve the problem after the problem's properties are explored. Numerical studies were conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model and effectiveness of the solution algorithm. Prospective work includes application of the proposed development approach to a real-world case study.

AB  - Understanding human activity patterns plays a key role in various applications in an urban environment, such as transportation planning and traffic forecasting, urban planning, public health and safety, and emergency response. Most existing studies in modeling human activity patterns mainly focus on spatiotemporal dimensions, which lacks consideration of underlying semantic context. In fact, what people do and discuss at some places, inferring what is happening at the places, cannot be simple neglected because it is the root of human mobility patterns. We believe that the geo-tagged semantic context, representing what individuals do and discuss at a place and a specific time, drives a formation of specific human activity pattern. In this paper, we aim to model human activity patterns not only based on space and time but also with consideration of associated semantics, and attempt to prove a hypothesis that similar mobility patterns may have different motivations. We develop a spatiotemporal-semantic model to quantitatively express human activity patterns based on topic models, leading to an analysis of space, time and semantics. A case study is conducted using Twitter data in Toronto based on our model. Through computing the similarities between users in terms of spatiotemporal pattern, semantic pattern and spatiotemporal-semantic pattern, we find that only a small number of users (2.72%) have very similar activity patterns, while the majority (87.14%) show different activity patterns (i.e., similar spatiotemporal patterns and different semantic patterns, similar semantic patterns and different spatiotemporal patterns, or different in both). The population of users that has very similar activity patterns is decreased by 56.41% after incorporating semantic information in the corresponding spatiotemporal patterns, which can quantitatively prove the hypothesis. © 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

AB  - Combining spectrum sensing (SS) and primary user (PU) traffic forecasting provides a cognitive radio network with a platform from which informed and proactive operational decisions can be made. The success of these decisions is largely dependent on prediction accuracy. Allowing secondary users (SU) to perform these predictions in a collaborative manner allows for an improvement in the accuracy of this process, since individual SUs may suffer from SS and prediction inaccuracies due to poor channel conditions. To overcome these problems a collaborative approach to forecasting PU traffic behaviour, that combines SS and forecasting through SU cooperation, has been proposed in this article. Both pre-fusion and post-fusion scenarios for cooperative prediction were investigated and a number of binary prediction methods were considered (including the authors’ own simple technique). Cooperative prediction performance was investigated, under various PU traffic conditions, for a group of ten SUs experiencing different channel conditions and a sub-optimal cooperative forecasting algorithm was proposed to minimise cooperative prediction error. Simulation results indicated that the accuracy of the prediction methods was influenced by the PU traffic pattern and that cooperative prediction lead to a significant improvement in prediction accuracy under most of the traffic conditions considered. However, this came at the cost of increased computational complexity. The pre-fusion scenario was found to be the most accurate scenario (up to 25 % improvement), but was also eleven times more complex than when no fusion was employed. The cooperative forecasting algorithm was found to further improve these results. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - We propose a new anticipation cooperative-driving lattice hydrodynamic model by considering the information of multiple sites ahead and the effect of traffic forecasting in the same time. Using linear stability theory, we carry out the stability analysis of the proposed model and show that the stability of traffic flow is enhanced effectively by the new consideration. From the simulation of space-time evolution of density, it is shown that the traffic jam could be suppressed efficiently via just taking into account the information of three sites ahead, and the analytical results are consistent with the simulation ones.

AB  - Difference needs in bandwidth allocations have not been accommodated by static bandwidth allocations that leads to ineffective bandwidth use. There are several previous researches about bandwidth allocations which have been conducted, such as the use of Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) method. However, SARIMA method is not able to overcome various kinds of error problems or heteroscedasticity. Therefore, this research proposes the application of SARIMA-EGARCH (Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic) method to generate the more accurate model that is able to overcome heteroscedasticity on the needs of bandwidth forecasting. In addition, this research compares the result of SARIMA to SARIMA-EGARCH examinations. It shows that SARIMA (1,0,1) (3,1,1)7 has 11,38% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and SARIMA-EGARCH (1,0,1)(3,1,1)7(1,1) has only 9,20%. The comparison shows that applying EGARCH increase the accuracy to 19,15%. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.

AB  - Short-term traffic flow prediction is a critical aspect of Intelligent Transportation System. Timely and accurate traffic forecasting results are necessary inputs for advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) and advanced traveler information systems (ATIS). Despite the proliferation of advanced methodologies, modeling the uncertainty of traffic conditions is still a challenge, especially during congested situations. This paper presents a hybrid model for multi-step ahead traffic flow forecasting in a freeway system with real-time traffic flow data. This proposed methodology forecasts traffic flow by decomposing the data into three modeling components: an intra-day or periodic trend by introducing the spectral analysis technique, a deterministic part modeled by the ARIMA model, and the volatility estimated by the GJR-GARCH model. The aim of this study is to provide deeper insights into underlining traffic patterns and to improve the prediction accuracy and reliability by modeling these patterns separately. The forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model is investigated with real time freeway traffic flow data from Houston, Texas. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to unearth the underlying periodic characteristics and volatility nature of traffic flow data and show promising abilities in improving the accuracy and reliability of freeway traffic flow forecasting in multi-step ahead forecasting. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Real-time monitoring and forecasting technology for network traffic continues to play an important role in network management. Effective network traffic prediction detects and avoids potential overload problems before they occur, which significantly improves network availability and stability. Recent research has centered around Time Series Analysis based traffic prediction methods that primarily extend Neural Network Forecasting (NNF) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) algorithms, which are not without their drawbacks. Given the vulnerabilities of existing nonlinear prediction methods in forecasting modeling, this paper presents a novel, Relevant Local (RL) forecast method and its accompanying Pattern Search (PS) parameter-optimization approach to introduce a new small-scale network traffic forecasting algorithm called RL-LSSVM (Relevant Local-Least squares support vector machine). Furthermore, we demonstrate our new algorithm on network traffic data collected from wired campus networks and show that the RL-LSSVM can effectively predict the small scale traffic measurement data while exhibit significantly improved prediction accuracy than existing algorithms. © 2015 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.

AB  - The rapid proliferation of Global Position Service (GPS) devices and mounting number of traffic monitoring systems employed by municipalities have opened the door for advanced traffic control and personalized route planning. Most state of the art traffic management and information systems focus on data analysis, and very little has been done in the sense of prediction. In this article, we devise an efficient system for the prediction of peak traffic flow using machine learning techniques. In the proposed system, the traffic flow of a locality is predicted with the aid of the geospatial data obtained from aerial images. The proposed system comprises of two significant phases: Geospatial data extraction from aerial images, and traffic flow prediction using See5.0 decision tree. Firstly, geographic information essential for traffic flow prediction are extracted from aerial images like traffic maps, using suitable image processing techniques. Subsequently, for a user query, the trained See5.0 decision tree predicts the traffic state of the intended location with relevance to the date and time specified. The experimental results portray the effectiveness of the proposed system in predicting traffic flow.

AB  - With the wide variety of motion sensors that traffic information can come from many research has been reserved for the development of traffic forecast, which in turn increases the shipping routes, traffic management, urban planning, etc. The most important challenge is to predict how traffic based on predictive models based on historical data traffic in real time, which may differ from historical data and change over time. In this system can learn new context of the current online traffic situation (or context) in real time, most effectively formed using a predictive historical data traffic model is intended to predict the future of the current situation. If traffic in real time, distributed environment enters the bloodstream space efficiently adapt to assess the effectiveness of each significant predictor different situations. We can show you the way, and short-term and long-term performance guarantees (STEP), our algorithm is designed in accordance with the algorithm works well in situations where there are no real signs (for ex. Traffic Ready) or later. We proposed an algorithm called “Extraction and Processing of situation Spatiotemporal traffic using SVM algorithm with Big data” By using the proposed framework, a context in which the most important is to predict the traffic by monitoring the movement of vehicles, which can further reduce the complexity of the request and inform the trade-policy. Our experience with real data in real-time circumstances indicates that the proposed approach is superior to existing solutions. © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.

AB  - In optical networking, virtual topologies have been introduced mainly to provide service providers with logical connections equipped with a reserved amount of bandwidth, which can be exploited to interconnect their equipment at the edges of the transport infrastructure. Virtual topologies are thus basically an abstraction of the real substrate, created by means of a process called virtual topology design (VTD). VTD is a complex task, affected by many parameters and constraints, and among them current traffic conditions are very relevant. Indeed, it is possible that after a certain time a virtual topology becomes inappropriate to serve current traffic. In such cases, the virtual topology can be reconfigured by creating new lightpaths or modifying or deleting existing ones, thus possibly creating some service interruptions. In this paper a new virtual topology reconfiguration technique is presented. In this technique, a cognitive entity designs and reconfigures virtual topologies by exploiting traffic forecasting solutions and taking advantage of past history. Moreover, a new transition method is also proposed to reduce the impact of instable routing tables during the reconfiguration process. We demonstrate, by means of simulation, the advantages of the proposed methods, as they reduce both the operational costs and the resources in operation while maintaining low packet loss ratio. Furthermore, we validate the operation of the proposed solutions in an emulated testbed. © 2015 OSA.

AB  - Signalized intersection delay is an important evaluation index of the signalized intersection capacity and service level. This study presents a signalized intersection delay model for signalized intersection. The model uses the methods which combine the RBF neural network with stochastic service system and also uses MATLAB for computing simulation. It discusses the characteristics of the operation in the arrival and leaving process. The simulation results show that the RBF network can identify nonlinear complex systems and is more suitable for the short-term traffic forecasts. The theory of stochastic service system is practicable in vehicle delay and operating characteristic. It can provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the signal and is better to adapt the continual changes of traffic conditions than traditional methods. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - With the availability of increasingly more new data sources collected for transportation in recent years, the computational effort for traffic flow forecasting in standalone modes has become increasingly demanding for large-scale networks. Distributed modeling strategies can be utilized to reduce the computational effort. In this paper, we present a MapReduce-based approach to processing distributed data to design a MapReduce framework of a traffic forecasting system, including its system architecture and data-processing algorithms. The work presented here can be applied to many traffic forecasting systems with models requiring a learning process (e.g., the neural network approach). We show that the learning process of the forecasting model under our framework can be accelerated from a computational perspective. Meanwhile, model fusion, which is the key problem of distributed modeling, is explicitly treated in this paper to enhance the capability of the forecasting system in data processing and storage. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - The day-to-day volatility of traffic series provides valuable information for accurately tracking the complex characteristics of short-term traffic such as stochastic noise and nonlinearity. Recently, support vector regression (SVR) has been applied for short-term traffic forecasting. However, standard SVR adopts a global and fixed ε-margin, which not only fails to tolerate the day-to-day traffic variation, but also requires a blind and time-consuming searching procedure to obtain a suitable value for ε. In this work, on the ground of stochastic modeling of day-to-day traffic variation, we propose an adaptive SVR short-term traffic forecasting model. The time-varying deviation of the day-to-day traffic variation, described in a bilevel formula, is integrated into SVR as heuristic information to construct an adaptive ε-margin, in which both local and normalized factors are considered. Comparative experiments using field traffic data indicate that the proposed model consistently outperforms the standard SVR with an improved computational efficiency. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Recent empirical studies have found widespread inaccuracies in traffic forecasts despite the fact that travel demand forecasting models have been significantly improved over the past few decades. We suspect that an intrinsic selection bias may exist in the competitive project appraisal process, in addition to the many other factors that contribute to inaccurate traffic forecasts. In this paper, we examine the potential for selection bias in the governmental process of Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) transportation project appraisals. Although the simultaneous consideration of multiple criteria is typically used in practice, traffic flow estimate is usually a key criterion in these appraisals. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the selection bias associated with the highest flow estimate criterion. We develop two approaches to quantify the level and chance of inaccuracy caused by selection bias: the expected value approach and the probability approach. The expected value approach addresses the question ". to what extent is inaccuracy caused by selection bias?". The probability approach addresses the question ". what is the chance of inaccuracy due to selection bias?". The results of this analysis confirm the existence of selection bias when a government uses the highest traffic forecast estimate as the priority criterion for BOT project selection. In addition, we offer some insights into the relationship between the extent/chance of inaccuracy and other related factors. We do not argue that selection bias is the only reason for inaccurate traffic forecasts in BOT projects; however, it does appear that it could be an intrinsic factor worthy of further attention and investigation. © 2015.

AB  - This paper proposes an improved k-nearest neighbor (k-nn) model for short-term traffic forecasting and examines its applicability to forecasting for different links and time periods. The traditional k-nn model is adapted by formulating the weighted distance metric and the state vector, which consider both the temporal and spatial information. The adapted model's performance is examined in a numerical test where the data are derived from global positioning system (GPS) devices in 180 taxis running in Guiyang, China. The test results demonstrate that the model that considers both the temporal and spatial information outperforms models that only consider temporal information and that adaptation of distance metrics could significantly improve the forecasting accuracy. The adapted model shows the promising performance in comparison with the historical average (HA) model and the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The test results also indicate that information from the upstream and the downstream links plays almost the same important role in predicting the traffic conditions at the target link. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The literature is rich in travel time prediction because of its importance in intelligent transportation systems. Despite the proliferation of advanced methodologies, modeling the uncertainty of traffic conditions is still a challenge, especially during congested situations. Travel time reliability associated with its time-dependent variation provides a way to measure the system performance and has received extensive attention in recent years. In practice, one of the measures for travel time reliability is the identification of prediction intervals (PIs). The PI measurement has many potential applications in the development of systems that aim at disseminating real-time traffic information to travelers. From a management point of view, the PIs forecast the unreliable traffic periods and enable the selection of proper strategies to avoid or release possible traffic congestion. The generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model has proved to have the ability to model the uncertainties in the literature. However, the model has some drawbacks in traffic forecasting. To improve the quality of travel time reliability forecasting, this paper proposes two univariate volatility models and compares their performance in generating high-quantity PIs. Travel time data collected from automatic vehicle identification stations located along U.S. Highway 290 in Houston, Texas, are used to examine each model's performance in travel time reliability forecasting. Study results indicate that all three models give reasonable PIs that could be used to indicate the variability of future traffic conditions. The statistical analysis and forecasting results indicate that the proposed Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle GARCH model outperforms the other two models in constructing better PIs.

AB  - Addressing performance related issues of networks and ensuring better Quality of Service (QoS) for end-users calls for simple, tractable and realistic traffic models. The work reported here focuses on modelling the Wireless Internet traffic using realistic traffic traces collected over wireless networks and forecasting the end-to-end QoS parameters for the networks. A measurement framework is set-up to collect the QoS parameters and a traffic model is designed based on Hidden Markov Model considering joint distribution of End to End Delay (E2ED or d), Inter-Packet Delay Variation (IPDV) and Packet Size. States are mapped to the four traffic classes namely conversational, streaming, interactive, and background. The model is validated by forecasting QoS parameters and the results are shown to be within the tolerance limit. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Forecasting traffic over a long period of time is of considerable interest and usefulness, but accurate forecasting is very difficult. Traditional projection and factoring methods for mid- and long-term cumulative traffic forecasting are deterministic and only provide a point prediction without specifying a statistical measure of prediction reliability. This paper constructs a stochastic projection and factoring method by casting long-term traffic volume counts into an integrated and rigorous framework of a more refined structural time series component model with piecewise stationary renewal processes capturing time-of-day, day-of-week, monthly, and yearly variations. By doing so, the new method roots itself in a solid theoretical foundation and generates two advantages. First, it results in a more accurate point prediction of cumulative traffic by taking into account the time-of-day traffic count variation in the modeling of unobservable future long-term traffic flow at temporary count stations or at a site under investigation as a mixture of piecewise stationary renewal processes with different means and variances. Second, it allows an interval prediction to be estimated by incorporating uncertainty into the modeling and forecasting process. ©2016 INFORMS.

AB  - For mobile communication traffic series, an accurate multistep prediction result plays an important role in network management, capacity planning, traffic congestion control, channel equalization, etc. A novel time series forecasting based on echo state networks and multiplicative seasonal ARIMA model are proposed for this multiperiodic, nonstationary, mobile communication traffic series. Motivated by the fact that the real traffic series exhibits periodicities at the cycle of 6, 12, and 24 h, as well as 1 week, we isolate most of mentioned above features for each cell and integrate all the wavelet multiresolution sublayers into two parts for consideration of alleviating the accumulated error. On seasonal characters, multiplicative seasonal ARIMA model is to predict the seasonal part, and echo state networks are to deal with the smooth part because of its prominent approximation capabilities and convenience. Experimental results on real traffic dataset show that proposed method performs well on the prediction accuracy. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - The densification and expansion of wireless networks pose new challenges on energy efficiency. With a drastic increase of infrastructure nodes (e.g. ultradense deployment of small cells), the total energy consumption may easily exceed an acceptable level. While most studies focus on the energy radiated by the antennas, the bigger part of the total energy budget is actually consumed by the hardware (e.g., coolers and circuit energy consumption). The ability to shut down infrastructure nodes (or parts of it) or to adapt the transmission strategy according to the traffic will therefore become an important design aspect of energy-efficient wireless ?architectures. Network infrastructure should be ?regarded as a resource that can be occupied or released on demand, and the modeling and optimization of such systems are highly nontrivial problems. In particular, elements of the network infrastructure should be released by taking into account traffic forecasts to avoid losing the required coverage and capacity. However, even if traffic profiles were perfectly known, the determination of the elements to be released is complicated by the potential interference coupling between active elements and the sheer size of the optimization problems in dense networks. © 1991-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate short-term traffic forecasting can relieve traffic congestion and improve the mobility of transportation, which is very important for management modernization of transportation systems. However, it is quite difficult to predict effectively and accurately short-term traffic information since traffic information shows the strongly nonlinear, complex and uncertain characteristics. In this paper, a new hybrid model based on grey neural network and fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) is proposed to solve this problem. The FOA is used to select the appropriate parameter values of the grey neural network model, thereby improving the accuracy of forecasting model. The proposed hybrid model can exploit sufficiently the characteristics of grey system model requiring less data, the non-linear map of neural networks and the quick-speed convergence of FOA, and has simpler structure. The effectiveness of this proposed hybrid model is proved by experiment simulation. The experiment results show that the proposed model has better performance than the single grey model GM(1,1), the single back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model, the combined model of them, i.e., the grey neural network (GNN) model, and the GNN model with particle swarm optimization (GNN-PSO), on short-term traffic forecasting. © 2017, International Association of Engineers.

AB  - With increasing popularity of high speed trains and traffic forecast for future cellular networks, the need to provide improved data rates using higher frequency bands (HFBs) for train passengers is becoming crucial. In this paper, we modify the OFDM frame structure for HST, taking into account the increasing sensitivity to speed at HFBs. A lower bound on the SNR/SINR for a given rate for reliable communication was derived considering the physical layer parameters from the OFDM frame. We also analyze different pathloss models in the context of examining the required gain needed to achieve the same performance as with microwave bands. Finally, we present a time-based analogue beamforming selection approach for HST. We observed that, irrespective of the pathloss models used, the required gains are within the same range. For the same SNR/SINR at different frequency bands, the achievable data rate varies with respect to the frequency bands. Our results show the potential of the use of HFBs. However, due to the increased sensitivity of some channel parameters, a maximum frequency band of 38 GHz is suggested. Evaluation of our proposed beamforming scheme indicates a close performance to the optimal SVD scheme with a marginal rate gap of less than 2 b/s/Hz. © 2017 Ayotunde O. Laiyemo et al.

AB  - Adverse weather conditions may have a significant impact on the statistical characteristics of traffic variables such as volume and speed, and consequently on their predictability.We address the problem of freeway lane speed variability under the effect of precipitation episodes and present a non-linear dynamics methodology based on recurrence quantification analysis to compare speed evolution under fine and adverse weather conditions. Findings indicate that, under fine weather conditions, section travel speed is an adequate descriptor of traffic evolution in the left and middle lanes for high demand, but fails in cases of incidents or low traffic. Moreover, when it rains, regardless of intensity and duration, a significantly dissimilar evolution of lane speed is observed; this difference should be considered in the process of short-term traffic forecasting. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

AB  - Inclement weather, such as heavy rain, significantly affects road traffic flow operation, which may cause severe congestion in road networks in cities. This study investigates the effect of inclement weather, such as rain events, on traffic flow and proposes an integrated model for traffic flow parameter forecasting during such events. First, an analysis of historical observation data indicates that the forecasting error of traffic flow volume has a significant linear correlation with mean precipitation, and thus, forecasting accuracy can be considerably improved by applying this linear correlation to correct forecasting values. An integrated online precipitation-correction model was proposed for traffic flow volume forecasting based on these findings. We preprocessed precipitation data transformation and used outlier detection techniques to improve the efficiency of the model. Finally, an integrated forecasting model was designed through data fusion methods based on the four basic forecasting models and the proposed online precipitation-correction model. Results of the model validation with the field data set show that the designed model is better than the other models in terms of overall accuracy throughout the day and under precipitation. However, the designed model is not always ideal under heavy rain conditions. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Rapid development of maritime container transport within the last two decades encouraged port authorities to focus on a more precise traffic forecast in order to cope with software and hardware requirements just in time. It has been the case for Iranian Ports and Maritime Organization (PMO) to map marine traffic until 2025. This has been performed in this paper based on three distinct scenarios, namely, "simplified continuous growth," "port best experience replication," and "regional best practice" for four main container ports of the country based on seventeen years recorded trade data. Such results should be used as input to assess smoothness of port functions in future. Besides, Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI) has been discussed to draw Iran's probable participation in the global container trade and shipping services within the next ten years. © 2017 Roozbeh Panahi et al.

AB  - Parallel, coordinated, and network-wide traffic management requires accurate and efficient traffic forecasting models to support online, real-time, and proactive dynamic control. Forecast accuracy is impacted by a critical characteristic of traffic flow, i.e., overdispersion. Efficiency depends on the time complexity of forecasting algorithms. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal multivariate forecasting model that is based on the negative binomial additive models (NBAMs). Negative binomial is utilized to handle overdispersion, and additive models are used to efficiently smooth nonlinear spatial and temporal variables. To evaluate the model, it is applied to real-world data collected from Taipei City and compared with other forecasting models. The results indicate that the proposed model is an accurate and efficient approach in forecasting traffic flow in urban context where flow is overdispersed, autocorrelated, and influenced by upstream and downstream roads as well as the daily seasonal patterns, namely, low-, moderate-, and high-traffic seasons. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the risk analysis of revenue and traffic forecast of a Build Operate Transfer (BOT) road project using cumulative distribution method. In road project, traffic is the main source to earn money/revenue. Traffic is projected using various methods. Actual traffic may not follow the projected traffic and actual traffic may be reduced/increased depending on the development of the road side and near areas. Rapid development i. e., industrial, commercial, business activity creates rapid traffic growth rate which is not expected and reverse happening where road side development is negligible. Traditional traffic forecast may not consider the risk of projected traffic. This paper presents the risk analysis of the projected traffic and alternatively revenue with a real case study and determine lower and upper limit of revenue and expected revenue has been determined using Monte Carlo Simulation Method. © 2012 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Obtaining accurate information about current and near-term future traffic flows of all links in a traffic network has a wide range of applications, including traffic forecasting, vehicle navigation devices, vehicle routing, and congestion management. A major problem in getting traffic flow information in real time is that the vast majority of links is not equipped with traffic sensors. Another problem is that factors affecting traffic flows, such as accidents, public events, and road closures, are often unforeseen, suggesting that traffic flow forecasting is a challenging task. In this paper, we first use a dynamic traffic simulator to generate flows in all links using available traffic information, estimated demand, and historical traffic data available from links equipped with sensors. We implement an optimization methodology to adjust the origin-to-destination matrices driving the simulator. We then use the real-time and estimated traffic data to predict the traffic flows on each link up to 30 min ahead. The prediction algorithm is based on an autoregressive model that adapts itself to unpredictable events. As a case study, we predict the flows of a traffic network in San Francisco, CA, USA, using a macroscopic traffic flow simulator. We use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate our methodology. Our simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. The traffic flow prediction errors vary from an average of 2% for 5-min prediction windows to 12% for 30-min windows even in the presence of unpredictable events. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - The study leveraged modern portfolio theory and stochastic time series models to develop a risk management strategy for future traffic projections along brownfield toll facilities. Uncertainty in future traffic forecasts may raise concerns about performance reliability and revenue potential. Historical time series traffic data from brownfield corridors were used for developing econometric forecast estimates, and Monte Carlo simulation was used to quantify a priori risks or variance to develop optimal forecasts by using mean-variance optimization strategies. Numerical analysis is presented with historical toll transactions along the Massachusetts Turnpike system. Suggested diversification strategies were found to achieve better long-term forecast efficiencies with improved trade-offs between anticipated risks and returns. Planner and agency forecast performance expectations and risk propensity are thus jointly captured.

AB  - Time series prediction has been successfully used in several application areas, such as meteorological forecasting, market prediction, network traffic forecasting, etc., and a number of techniques have been developed for modeling and predicting time series. In the traditional exponential smoothing method, a fixed weight is assigned to data history, and the trend changes of time series are ignored, in this paper, an uncertainty reasoning method, based on cloud model, is employed in time series prediction, which uses cloud logic, controller to adjust the smoothing coefficient of the simple exponential smoothing method dynamically to fit the current trend of the time series. The validity of this solution was proved by experiments on various data sets.

AB  - An algorithm for the implementation of short-term prediction of traffic with real-time updating based on spectral analysis is described. The prediction is based on the characterization of the flow based on modal functions associated with a covariance matrix constructed from historical flow data. The number of these modal functions used for prediction depends on the local traffic characteristics. Although the method works well for the examples in this paper using the lower frequency modes, it can be adapted to include modes of higher frequency, as traffic conditions dictate. This paper describes the intended online implementation of the method that predicts within-day traffic flow using a forecasting horizon of 1 h 15 min with a 15-min step. Thus, every 15 min, the traffic flow for a further 1 h 15 min is predicted. As well as forecasting to this horizon, a second algorithm incorporating a weighted averaging technique is developed, which allows the prediction of one 15-min step ahead by using current and previous predictions of traffic flows at the given time instant while placing more weight on the more recent predictions. This technique combines the features of a time-series-based prediction with spectral analysis. The development of an algorithm for the real-time implementation is described, and results are presented for a number of different schemes. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Predictions of short-term traffic volume support proactive transportation management and traveler information services. To address the periodicity, nonlinearity, uncertainty, and complexity of short-term traffic forecasting, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and support vector machine (SVM) models are often used separately to forecast the time series of traffic flow. SARIMA can discover intrinsic relations (correlations) in time series data, especially fit for modeling seasonal, stochastic time series. In contrast, SVM has a strong nonlinear mapping ability for input and output, appropriate for solving complex, nonlinear problems. The few combined schemes that have been presented previously tend to be complicated. A simple and effective novel hybrid methodology that combines the SARIMA and SVM models is proposed to take advantage of the individual strengths of the two models. Two key issues in building a hybrid model process are discussed: identification of SVM input dimensions via SARIMA and parameter optimization of the hybrid model with particle swarm optimization. Experimental results with real-world data sets indicated that the hybrid model was superior to the individual SARIMA or SVM model in terms of root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error for the prediction of the short-term traffic flow.

AB  - Since traffic in IP access networks is less aggregated than in backbone networks, its variance could be significant and its distribution may be long-tailed rather than Gaussian in nature. Such characteristics make it difficult to forecast traffic volume in IP access networks for appropriate capacity planning. This paper proposes a traffic forecasting method that includes a function to control residual error distribution in IP access networks. The objective of the proposed method is to grasp the statistical characteristics of peak traffic variations, while conventional methods focus on average rather than peak values. In the proposed method, a neural network model is built recursively while weighting residual errors around the peaks. This enables network operators to control the trade-off between underestimation and overestimation errors according to their planning policy. Evaluation with a total of 136 daily traffic volume data sequences measured in actual IP access networks demonstrates the performance of the proposed method.

AB  - Although the rapid growth in light truck vehicle (LTV) sales, including minivans, sports utility vehicles (SUVs), and light-duty trucks, has not been associated with an overall increase in collisions or traffic deaths in the US, there is a need for a research program to determine whether particular types of collisions have become more frequent or injurious because of the increase in the percent of LTVs in traffic. This paper presents an analysis of the effect of the increasing number of LTV registrations on fatal angle collision trends in the US. The analysis investigates the number of annual fatalities that result from angle collisions as well as collision configuration (car-car, car-LTV, LTV-car, and LTV-LTV). The analysis uses the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) crash databases covering the period 1975-2000. Results showed that death rates differ based on the collision configuration. Time series modeling results showed that fatalities in angle collisions will increase in the next 10 years, and that they are affected by the expected increase in the percentage of LTVs in traffic. Forecast showed that the total number of annual deaths is expected to reach 6300 deaths by the year 2010 (an increase of 12% over 2000). Analysis into the configuration of the collision indicated the seriousness of angle collisions involving an LTV striking a common passenger car (LTV-car). A time series model illustrated the significance of time lag and percent of LTVs in traffic on the increase of this type of fatal collisions. Forecasts from the time series model indicated a 32% increase in deaths due to this type of collisions in the next 10 years. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate and timely forecasting of traffic flow is of paramount importance for effective management of traffic congestion in intelligent transportation systems. A detailed understanding of the properties of traffic flow is essential for building a reliable forecasting model. The discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) provides more coefficients than the conventional discrete wavelet transform (DWT), representing additional subtle details of a signal. In wavelet multiresolution analysis, an important decision is the selection of the decomposition level. In this research, the statistical autocorrelation function (ACF) is proposed for the selection of the decomposition level in wavelet multiresolution analysis of traffic flow time series. A hybrid wavelet packet-ACF method is proposed for analysis of traffic flow time series and determining its self-similar, singular, and fractal properties. A DWPT-based approach combined with a wavelet coefficients penalization scheme and soft thresholding is presented for denoising the traffic flow. The proposed methodology provides a powerful tool in removing the noise and identifying singularities in the traffic flow. The methods created in this research are of value in developing accurate traffic-forecasting models. © 2004 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.

AB  - Birmingham International Airport (BIA) has amended its long-term development masterplan by discarding the plan to construct a second parallel runway. BIA announced that the updated traffic forecasts have indicated that a second runway should not be required before 2030, and further development will be planned on that basis. The 400 m extension to the southern end of the existing runway would increase the runway length to 3,000 m, with a starter strip providing a maximum takeoff run of 3,150 m. A planning application for the runway extension is being finalized and is due to be submitted by the end of the year 2007.

AB  - The paper develops a short-term space-time traffic flow forecasting strategy integrating the empirical-based seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series forecasting technique with the theoretical-based first-order macroscopic traffic flow model-cell transmission model. A case study in Dublin city center which has serious traffic congestion is performed to test the effectiveness of the proposed multivariate traffic forecasting strategy. The results show that the forecasts at the junctions only deviate around 10% at a maximum from the original observations and seem to indicate that the proposed strategy is one of the effective approaches to predict the real-time traffic flow level in a congested network especially at the locations where no continuous data collection takes place. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - The ACI Global Traffic Forecast 2006-25 predicts that the current passenger numbers will double within the next 20 years. ACI indicates that over nine billion passengers a year will use the world's airports by 2025, up from 4.2 billion in 2005. Insufficient development of the essential infrastructure is expected to result in customer discomfort, which is required to understood by the industry partners, regulators and governments. Passenger volumes are predicted to grow by an average of 4% annually over the 20-year period, with Asia leading at a rate of nine per cent until 2009 and challenging North America as the largest market by 2025. Freight operations, such as freight tonnage carried worldwide will increase by three times, and an average growth of 5.4 per cent annually-ally over the next 20 years. Many airports may be facing a serious capacity shortfall if unable to urgently address infrastructure needs.

AB  - Air traffic forecast projects an important increase of aeronautical communications at the 2020 timeframe. The actual communication infrastructure which supports ATM (Air Traffic Management) cannot deal with this evolution of data volume exchanged in dense areas. The SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) European project has started to prepare the Future Communication Infrastructure (FCI), with aviation stakeholders. To feed the investigations on the Future Communication Infrastructure, a joint study between ESA (European Space Agency) and CNES has been performed to prove that satellite communications system can be a good candidate to participate in the FCI. Technical and economical viability have been studied during this activity. © 2007/2008 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate short-term traffic forecasting is the foundation of optimal control and guidance for urban traffic. Traffic flow has the characteristics of strong non-linearity, uncertainty and dynamics, thus it is highly difficult to predict short-term traffic flow accurately. Least square support vector regression (LS-SVR) possesses the performances of global optimum and fast computing speed, and it is an appropriate means for function approximation problems. The selection of kernel function has significant impacts on the regularization performance of LS-SVR. In contrast to the conventional kernels such as radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial functions in LS-SVR, wavelet functions can approximate arbitrary functions in square integrable space. In this work, we propose a wavelet LS-SVR for short-term traffic flow forecasting. Mexican hat function is proved to satisfy Mercer condition and introduced as kernel function of LS-SVR. Through experimentally investigation, we found that Mexican hat based LS-SVR has higher forecasting accuracy than Shannon and Morlet based LS-SVRs. Moreover, this proposed method is compared with the other typical forecasting models such as auto regression moving average model (ARIMA), neural network (NN) based model and RBF kernel based LS-SVR model. The experimental results illustrate that for 5 minutes, 10 minutes and 15 minutes prediction time periods, the forecasting accuracy of our method outperforms those of the other models. © 2010 SoftMotor Ltd.

AB  - Short-term prediction of traffic parameters is very important for proactive transportation management. The past two decades have witnessed many forecasting models being developed, yet none of them could consistently outperform the others. Layered predicting approaches take a 'divide and conquer' strategy by classifying traffic flow series into simpler regimes so that regime-specific models can be trained to handle simplified traffic states. However, traffic regimes are inherently drifting for real world traffic systems. In this paper, a layered real-time neural network ensemble learning approach is developed to address the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of traffic data. A flexible dynamic weighted ensemble forecasting system that combines adjustable numbers of neural network predictors according to their real-time prediction performance is implemented. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively deal with the changing traffic regimes and produce satisfactory online short-term traffic forecasts.

AB  - A hybrid neuro-fuzzy application for short-term freeway traffic volume forecasting was developed. The hybrid model consists of two components: a fuzzy C-means (FCM) method, which classifies traffic flow patterns into a couple of clusters, and a radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network, which develops forecasting models associated with each cluster. The new hybrid model was compared with previously developed clustering-based RBF models. In addition, the dynamic linear model was studied for comparison. The study results showed that the clustering-based hybrid method did not produce time-lag phenomena, whereas the dynamic linear model and the RBF model without clustering revealed apparent time-lag phenomena. The forecasting performance for free-way traffic volumes from the San Antonio, Texas, TransGuide system shows that even though the hybrid of the FCM and RBF models appears to be promising, additional research efforts should be devoted to achieving more reliable traffic forecasting.

AB  - The need for acquiring the current-year traffic data is a problem for transport planners since such data may not be available for on-going transport studies. A method is proposed in this paper to predict hourly traffic flows up to and into the near future, using historical data collected from the Hong Kong Annual Traffic Census (ATC). Two parametric and two non-parametric models have been employed and evaluated in this study. The results show that the non-parametric models (Non-Parametric Regression (NPR) and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (GML)) were more promising for predicting hourly traffic flows at the selected ATC station. Further analysis encompassing 87 ATC stations revealed that the NPR is likely to react to unexpected changes more effectively than the GML method, while the GML model performs better under steady traffic flows. Taking into consideration the dynamic nature of the common traffic patterns in Hong Kong and the advantages/disadvantages of the various models, the NPR model is recommended for predicting the hourly traffic flows in that region. © Springer 2006.

AB  - An important problem in bandwidth allocation and reservation over a communication link is to estimate the traffic bit rate in that link. This can be done by using specific tools for measurements of the traffic bit rate. However, the obtained measures are affected by some noise. Moreover, one might be interested in future traffic forecasting, when a prediction is needed. In this paper, an iterative filtering procedure is proposed for updating the traffic estimate upon the arrival of a new measurement. A birth and death stochastic model is assumed for the traffic bit rate to provide dynamical equations for the average behavior in the absence of information carried by measurements. Approximate solutions of the same updating problem are also given under the assumption that the posterior distribution of the traffic bit rate belongs to a specific class (beta or Gaussian distribution). This leads to approximate filtering procedures, which are expected to provide significant computational advantages. Finally, results obtained by processing simulated and real data are presented; stressing that the practical behavior of the approximate filters is quite satisfactory. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the long-range dependence of Internet traffic, the sampling distribution of the variance is very hard to obtain and, as a result, confidence intervals cannot be provided. Nevertheless, we show that the r-decimated variance sampling distribution can be approximated by a χ2 distribution. This sampling technique can be used to provide a confidence interval for the variance, with significant benefits for many applications in Internet dimensioning, traffic forecasting and control. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has pursued continual refinement in the waterway traffic forecasts used in project economic analyses. The multiscenario forecasting of utility steam coal described in this paper, based on the work of Hill & Associates, Inc. (H&A), is a substantial refinement of previous forecasting efforts. H&A prepares 20-year steam coal forecasts on the basis of the interaction of two major linear programming models: the National Power Model (NPM) and the Utility Fuel Economics Model (UFEM). The NPM is a utility industry model that dispatches all electric generating plants in the United States (coal and noncoal), producing forecasts of generation by fuel type within a context of transmission and environmental constraints. The UFEM makes use of highly detailed coal supply data (for approximately 98 coal types) to allocate fuels among plants and units. These two models develop forecasts of coal demand for electricity generation, by type of coal, which were then "mapped" to the waterway. H&A prepared separate forecast scenarios based on three alternative environmental regulatory futures. The first is a continuation of existing law (in this case, the national ambient air quality standards). The second H&A scenario reflects implementation of the administration's Clear Skies Initiative. The final H&A scenario is an implementation of the Clear Skies Initiative without the proposal's severe mercury restrictions.

AB  - Moving toward the third-generation (3G), wireless service providers (WSPs) have key decisions to make in evolving their backbone networks in a costeffective way. Today, most WSPs in the United States deploy fully meshed, circuit-switched metro backbone networks and hand off long-distance traffic to an interchange carrier (IXC). With the increased complexity of managing a growing meshed network and the emergence of enhanced data services, the goal is to evolve toward a multi-service packet network. This paper presents a rigorous model for circuit-to-packet (C2P) network evolution planning that addresses evolution alternatives for voice services, technology choice, network architectures, design, performance, reliability, and financial analysis. The model allows WSPs to quantify the benefits of various evolution scenarios and helps Lucent Mobility Solutions assess product roadmaps. The paper also presents a case study based on typical code division multiple access (CDMA) WSPs in North America that examines various C2P evolution strategies in metro, regional, and national backbones based on different choices of technology (TDM vs. ATM vs. IP), product availability, network architectures, and traffic forecasts. Also included are key insights and a summary of the study results. © 2004 Lucent Technologies Inc.

AB  - It is difficult to approach the topic of this short Paper without commenting on overconfidence. Range estimation is popular in many disciplines where professionals, facing uncertainty, estimate Possible outcome ranges. Where estimates are biased by overconfidence, narrower ranges result. The psychology literature is rich with examples of individual and professional overconfidence. This form of behavioural bias has been tested by many academic studies and has been documented for - among others - investment bankers, financial analysts and economic forecasters (van der Venter & Michayluk, 2008). Are traffic forecasters any different? A literature review of behavioural research material reveals some consistent findings which could have relevance here: • Overconfidence increases with the prediction difficulty level (traffic forecasting is not easy); • The phenomenon occurs more frequently among males than females (this is a male-dominated profession); •... and increases with age and experience (the job titles of the survey respondents - described later - suggest relatively high levels of seniority). Overconfidence is not the central issue here. The paper focuses on a small survey and the survey results. However, reflecting on these results, some comments are made about overconfidence towards the end.

AB  - Short-term traffic volume forecasting represents a critical need for Intelligent Transportation Systems. This paper develops a novel forecasting approach inspired by human memory, called the spinning network (SPN). The approach is then used for short-term traffic volume forecasting, utilizing a data set compiled from real-world traffic volume data obtained from the Hampton Roads traffic operations center in Virginia. To assess the accuracy of the SPN approach, its performance is compared to two other approaches, namely a back propagation neural network and a nearest neighbor approach. The transferability of the SPN approach and its ability to forecast for longer time periods into the future is also assessed. The results of the performance testing conducted in this paper demonstrates the superior predictive accuracy and drastically lower computational requirements of the SPN compared to either the neural network or the nearest neighbor approach. The tests also confirm the ability of the SPN to predict traffic volumes for longer time periods into the future, as well as the transferability of the approach to other sites. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forecasting traffic and toll revenues for new highway projects involves great uncertainty because of the inherent uncertainty in the models used to make forecasts. As private investment becomes more common in project financing, quantifying the levels of risk and uncertainty associated with such projects becomes critical. This paper represents a review of many key studies and reports dealing with uncertainty in traffic and revenue forecasts for highway projects. These studies found that tolled projects tend to suffer from substantial optimism bias in forecasts, with predicted traffic volumes exceeding actual volumes by 30% or more about half the time. Moreover, projects with greater uncertainty tend to overestimate Year 1 traffic volumes more and stabilize at lower final traffic volumes. But after one controls for added optimism bias in traffic forecasts (compared with nontolled projects), there is little difference in uncertainty levels between tolled and nontolled forecasts. A typical way to address uncertainty in traffic forecasts is through sensitivity testing via variations in key inputs and parameters. A more extensive and less arbitrary version of this, Monte Carlo simulation, can provide probability distributions of future traffic and revenue, although it tends to require many simulations, demanding greater computational effort and time, unless networks are streamlined. Nonetheless, if reasonable assumptions for model input and parameter distributions can be made, Monte Carlo simulation generates a variety of useful information and establishes the actual likelihood of loss (rather than more basic win-lose indicators from a limited set of stress tests).

AB  - Wireless communications have always faced the scarceness of bandwidth and until today the cellular division has solved this problem by making radio cells always smaller. However, as cell size is reduced, more users will probably require handoffs, and signaling can overload the system. Further, the decrease in cell dimension cannot ensure the best utilization of system resources, because user density in the cell is not constant over the time. Dynamic allocation might be the solution, but it is a complex task, basically due to complexity of the models for the mobility prediction, especially in those environments where users move very fast (e.g. highways). This last one is a typical environment where high mobility of vehicles does not allow small cell sizes and thus system capacity is intrinsically bounded. In this paper, we deploy an analytical model for a cellular network operating in a high mobility environment. Such a model is capable of representing and forecasting wireless system evolution in terms of channel occupancy, starting from the current state of the mobile network and road traffic. This model has been defined by integrating a vehicular traffic model with a wireless cellular communication one. With such approach the dynamic behaviour of the most critical mobile terminals, those associated with vehicles, are described in a very precise and specific way with respect to mobility. Many results obtained with specific simulation tools and herein reported show the good behaviour of our proposal. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Forum has predicted that voice and data traffic on mobile networks will grow more than 30 times in future. A new report titled 'Mobile Traffic Forecasts 2010-2020', shows that the third-generation/fourth-generation (3G/4G) industry body indicates that the total annual traffic on mobile networks will globally reach 127 EB (exabytes) in 2020. The UMTS Forum estimates that mobile traffic in a typical Western European country will grow 67 times from 186 to 12,540 TB (terabytes) daily, which in turn will double the corresponding growth globally. The International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Mobile Phone Tracker reports that the worldwide mobile phone market grew 19.8% year over year in the first quarter of 2011. The firm estimates that vendors shipped 371.8 million units in the first quarter of 2011, compared with 310.5 million units in the first quarter of 2010. In-Stat expects that the number of WiFi Direct-enabled devices shipped in 2011 will reach 173 million.

AB  - Accurate and timely forecasting of traffic volume has long been regarded as a key point in transporttation, planning and management. In order to realize effective and efficient traffic forecasting, this paper investigates quantificational method of dynamic factors from the perspective of nearness. The dynamic modeling method based on quantificational dynamics (that is, quantificational disposal of dynamic factors according to nearness) is proposed and this method can significantly improve the forecast effectiveness and efficiency. Swarm simulation is adopted as a new tool with regard to the field of traffic forecasting for analysis and verification. The testing results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional ones in choosing training samples and constituting forecasting models. This work contributes to the consideration and evaluation of dynamic factors in scientific forecasting and may bring some enlightenment to relevant scientific researchers and engineers. © 2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - The performance of intelligent transportation systems is dependent on their adaptability to non-recurrent traffic flow events. A novel approach to detecting non-recurrent patterns observed in short-term traffic flow is presented. Traffic flow patterns are distinguished with respect to non determinism and high nonlinearity by analyzing the recurrent behavior of jointly considered series of volume and occupancy; these patterns are indicative of rare traffic events and are further studied. Findings show that rare patterns are likely to occur before traffic flow reaches congestion due to the increased traffic flow complexity. Regarding transitions, traffic flow has a frequent transitional nature, with interesting behavior in synchronized flow; results point to the existence of two regimes with different statistical characteristics with respect to determinism and nonlinearity. The observed statistical characteristics of traffic patterns can be a source of information on the short-term predictability of traffic flow for enhancing the accuracy of traffic forecasting models.

AB  - A reliable and accurate short-term traffic forecasting system is crucial for the successful deployment of any intelligent transportation system. A lot of forecasting models have been developed in recent years but none of them could consistently outperform the others. In real-world applications, traffic forecasting accuracy can be affected by a lot of factors. Impacts of long-term changes to traffic patterns to short-term traffic forecasting are profound and this can easily make an existing forecasting system outdated. Therefore, it is very important for forecasting systems to detect long-term changes in traffic patterns and make updates accordingly. This paper presents a new forecasting mechanism, in which a dynamic hybrid approach is taken and self-learning ability is enhanced. Results of a case study show the proposed approach is feasible in enhancing the adaptability of traffic forecasting systems. © 2012 Pion and its Licensors.

AB  - Single point short-term traffic flow forecasting will play a key role in supporting demand forecasts needed by operational network models. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), a classic parametric modeling approach to time series, and nonparametric regression models have been proposed as well suited for application to single point short-term traffic flow forecasting. Past research has shown seasonal ARIMA models to deliver results that are statistically superior to basic implementations of nonparametric regression. However, the advantages associated with a data-driven nonparametric forecasting approach motivate further investigation of refined nonparametric forecasting methods. Following this motivation, this research effort seeks to examine the theoretical foundation of nonparametric regression and to answer the question of whether nonparametric regression based on heuristically improved forecast generation methods approach the single interval traffic flow prediction performance of seasonal ARIMA models. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - For decades, simulation technique has been well validated in areas such as computer and communication systems. Recently, the technique has been much used in the area of transportation and traffic forecasting. Several methods have been proposed for investigating complex traffic flows. However, the dynamics of vehicles and diversities of driver characteristics have never been considered sufficiently in these methods, although they are considered important factors in traffic flow analysis. In this paper, we propose a traffic simulation tool called Multi-Agent for Traffic Simulation with Vehicle Dynamics Model (MATDYMO). Road transport consultants, traffic engineers and urban traffic control center managers are expected to use MATDYMO to efficiently simulate traffic flow. MATDYMO has four sub systems: the road management system, the vehicle motion control system, the driver management system, and the integration control system. The road management system simulates traffic flow for various traffic environments (e.g., multi-lane roads, nodes, virtual lanes, and signals); the vehicle motion control system constructs the vehicle agent by using various vehicle dynamic models; the driver management system constructs the driver agent capable of having different driving styles; and lastly, the integrated control system regulates the MATDYMO as a whole and observes the agents running in the system. The vehicle motion control system and driver management system are described in the companion paper. An interrupted and uninterrupted flow model were simulated, and the simulation results were verified by comparing them with the results from a commercial software, TRANS YT-7F. The simulation result of the uninterrupted flow model showed that the driver agent displayed human-like behavior ranging from slow and careful driving to fast and aggressive driving. The simulation of the interrupted flow model was implemented as two cases. The first case analyzed traffic flow as the traffic signals changed at different intervals and as the turning traffic volume changed. Second case analyzed the traffic flow as the traffic signals changed at different intervals and as the road length changed. The simulation results of the interrupted flow model showed that the close relationship between traffic state change and traffic signal interval. Copyright © 2006 KSAE.

AB  - Accurately predicting non-peak traffic is crucial to daily traffic for all forecasting models. In the paper, least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) are investigated to solve such a practical problem. It is the first time to apply the approach and analyze the forecast performance in the domain. For comparison purpose, two parametric and two non-parametric techniques are selected because of their effectiveness proved in past research. Having good generalization ability and guaranteeing global minima, LS-SVMs perform better than the others. Providing sufficient improvement in stability and robustness reveals that the approach is practically promising. © 2009 WASET.ORG.

AB  - Traffic forecasts provide essential input for the appraisal of transport investment projects. However, according to recent empirical evidence, long-term predictions are subject to high levels of uncertainty. This article quantifies uncertainty in traffic forecasts for the tolled motorway network in Spain. Uncertainty is quantified in the form of a confidence interval for the traffic forecast that includes both model uncertainty and input uncertainty. We apply a stochastic simulation process based on bootstrapping techniques. Furthermore, the article proposes a new methodology to account for capacity constraints in long-term traffic forecasts. Specifically, we suggest a dynamic model in which the speed of adjustment is related to the ratio between the actual traffic flow and the maximum capacity of the motorway. As an illustrative example, this methodology is applied to a specific public policy that consists of suppressing the toll on a certain motorway section before the concession expires. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Abstract: The existing well-known short-term traffic forecasting algorithms require large traffic flow data sets, including information on current traffic scenarios to predict the future traffic conditions. This article proposes a random process traffic volume model that enables estimation and prediction of traffic volume at sites where such large and continuous data sets of traffic condition related information are unavailable. The proposed model is based on a combination of wavelet analysis (WA) and Bayesian hierarchical methodology (BHM). The average daily "trend" of urban traffic flow observations can be reliably modeled using discrete WA. The remaining fluctuating parts of the traffic volume observations are modeled using BHM. This BHM modeling considers that the variance of the urban traffic flow observations from an intersection vary with the time-of-the-day. A case study has been performed at two busy junctions at the city-centre of Dublin to validate the effectiveness of the strategy. © 2010Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.

AB  - Traffic data and statistics (as density) are among the most important and crucial tools for the study of traffic, optimization of urban transportation and traffic programming. For this reason, the Tehran Traffic Control Company (TTCC) has built some data acquisition stations in various highway locations in Tehran. There are TTCC 10 data acquisition stations in use at the moment and more stations are to be designed and implemented in the future. The implementation of each station consists of three stages: field study, equipment installation and setting up magnetic rings, which require a long design time and high cost for data acquisition equipment, as well as induction sensors and heavy work load for installing magnetic rings. The final stage comes with many problems, particularly in highways, and needs high safety standards. Considering problems such as cost and safety of the implementation, the design of virtual stations seem necessary. A virtual station does not exist physically, but it can calculate traffic data. This proposal is known as Spatial Forecasting, which provides forecasting in space dimension using statistical data from present stations. The present article introduces an intelligent neuro-fuzzy structure which is trained over statistical traffic density data of the Modarres highway and is used for spatial forecasting. Results of simulation show that a neuro-fuzzy network can be used successfully for this purpose. © Shiraz University.

AB  - Traffic flow in large and complex freeway networks is a highly nonlinear phenomenon, which makes traffic forecast a difficult task. In this article an approach to traffic forecast is presented, which uses a micro-simulator for traffic flow combined with current and historical traffic data. The micro-simulator and locally measured current traffic data are used to reconstruct the current network-wide traffic state. Then, this state is combined with historical traffic data to forecast the traffic development. This framework is applied to the freeway network of the German state North Rhine-Westphalia. The micro-simulator uses an advanced cellular-automaton model for traffic flow, and the data are supplied from more than 4,000 locally installed loop-detectors, which deliver information on the (local) traffic state online minute by minute.

AB  - In Hong Kong, the annual traffic census report is published in the middle of the year and used to present the results of traffic volume recorded at the automatic traffic counter stations. The type of traffic volume data being widely used is the annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is estimated on the basis of the daily flows by 12 months in the whole surveyed year. In this paper, time series, neural network, nonparametric regression, and Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML) methods were adapted to develop four models for short-term prediction of the daily traffic flows by day of week and by month, as well as the AADT for the whole current year. The historical data (1994-1998) and available current-year data for 1999 partial daily flows are the input data used for model development. The results of the four models were compared with the real data for validation. The daily flows estimated by the four models were used to calculate the AADT for the current year of 1999. Based on the comparison results, the GML model appears to be the most promising and robust of these four models for extensive applications to provide the short-term traffic forecasting database for the whole territory of Hong Kong.

The financial evaluation model constitutes four distinct phases, namely (a) site selection and traffic forecasts, (b) definition of services offered and corresponding dimensions, (c) estimation of investment and operation costs and (d) evaluation of investments. Furthermore, the model produces financing scenarios, based on combinations of public and private funds.

AB  - As the transportation system usage grows, there remains of some challenges. On the one hand, the emergence of intelligent transportation system becomes increasingly attractive; on the other hand, researchers are hardly to access real-time and dynamic information about traffics. In this paper, a new solved approach is designed. At first, real-time data on incomplete public traffics are collected via Internet. Then to achieve reliable extracting bus trajectory, the algorithms are proposed that consists of two aspects: trajectory fragments are generated based strong correlation of original data and trajectory fragments are connected with minimum connection distance. To the best of our knowledge, there are the first results for solving these problems, which will lay on data basis for subsequent traffic forecast. At the same time, the proposed algorithm on eliminating abnormal data and tackle with mass data effectively will provide new knowledge and experience for similar research areas.

AB  - The performance of many components in intelligent transportation systems depends heavily on the quality of short-term traffic forecasts. We propose a new method for forecasting traffic based on type-2 fuzzy logic. Type-2 fuzzy logic is powerful in handling uncertainties, including uncertainties in measurements and data used to calibrate the parameters. In our formulation, the value of a membership function corresponding to a particular traffic state is no longer a crisp value. Rather, it is associated with a range of values that can be characterised by a function that reflects the level of uncertainty. Day-to-day traffic information is combined with real-time traffic information to construct fuzzy rules. The performance of the prediction procedure based on type-2 fuzzy logic is encouraging. The mean relative error is in the neighbourhood of 12 for occupancies and 5 for flows. A distinct advantage of a type-2 fuzzy logic-based traffic forecasting approach is that it can produce prediction intervals as a by-product of the fuzzy reduction process. Another desirable property of the proposed model is that the fuzzy engine formulated is usually tractable at every step, making it easy to incorporate site-specific information into the model-building process to obtain more accurate results.

AB  - Traffic forecasts are employed in the toll road sector, inter alia, by private sector investors to gauge the bankability of candidate investment projects. Although much is written in the literature about the theory and practice of traffic forecasting, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the predictive accuracy of traffic forecasting models. This paper addresses that shortcoming by reporting the results from the largest study of toll road forecasting performance ever conducted. The author had access to commercial-in-confidence documentation released to project financiers and, over a 4-year period, compiled a database of predicted and actual traffic usage for over 100 international, privately financed toll road projects. The findings suggest that toll road traffic forecasts are characterised by large errors and considerable optimism bias. As a result, financial engineers need to ensure that transaction structuring remains flexible and retains liquidity such that material departures from traffic expectations can be accommodated. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2009.

AB  - Project promoters, forecasters, and managers sometimes object to two things in measuring inaccuracy in travel demand forecasting: (1) using the forecast made at the time of making the decision to build as the basis for measuring inaccuracy and (2) using traffic during the first year of operations as the basis for measurement. This paper presents the case against both objections. First, if one is interested in learning whether decisions about building transport infrastructure are based on reliable information, then it is exactly the traffic forecasted at the time of making the decision to build that is of interest. Second, although ideally studies should take into account so-called demand "ramp up" over a period of years, the empirical evidence and practical considerations do not support this ideal requirement, at least not for large-N studies. Finally, the paper argues that large samples of inaccuracy in travel demand forecasts are likely to be conservatively biased, i.e., accuracy in travel demand forecasts estimated from such samples would likely be higher than accuracy in travel demand forecasts in the project population. This bias must be taken into account when interpreting the results from statistical analyses of inaccuracy in travel demand forecasting. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article focuses on the values of electrical switching vs. photonic switching in the context of telecom transport networks. In particular, we show that the requirement of providing agility at the optical layer in the face of traffic forecast uncertainties is served better through photonic switching. On the other hand, some of the network-level functions, such as fast protection, subwavelength aggregation, and flexible client connectivity, require electrical switching. We further argue that additional values are achieved with hybrid photonic and electrical switching, which do not exist when either of these options is used in isolation.

AB  - The planning of optical networks aims to design a configuration that meets the desired requirements while reducing the overall expenses. Many attributes of a network ultimately depend on the underlying physical topology. This work investigates an optimal topology design for given node locations based on a traffic forecast. Our goal is to minimize the total equipment costs, including the dimensioning of node and span capacities. We identify three main cost terms, namely duct costs for the span infrastructure, expenses that can be assigned to the fiber medium, and costs that involve switching functionality. Resilience against single or dual failures is guaranteed by constructing an appropriately meshed network structure that offers path diversity. We develop a mathematical program formulation and investigate a case study. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recognizing temporal patterns in traffic flow has been an important consideration in short-term traffic forecasting research. However, little work has been conducted on identifying and associating traffic pattern occurrence with prevailing traffic conditions. We propose a multilayer strategy that first identifies patterns of traffic based on their structure and evolution in time and then clusters the pattern-based evolution of traffic flow with respect to prevailing traffic flow conditions. Temporal pattern identification is based on the statistical treatment of the recurrent behavior of jointly considered volume and occupancy series; clustering is done via a two-level neural network approach. Results on urban signalized arterial 90-second traffic volume and occupancy data indicate that traffic pattern propagation exhibits variability with respect to its statistical characteristics such as deterministic structure and nonlinear evolution. Further, traffic pattern clustering uncovers four distinct classes of traffic pattern evolution, whereas transitional traffic conditions can be straightforwardly identified. © 2008 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.

AB  - In this letter, we address the impact of polarization-mode dispersion on the design of wavelength-routed optical networks. A mathematical formulation of the problem is provided which optimizes the cost of the network comprising the total number of regenerators and additional installed fiber for a given traffic forecast. The hill-climbing search algorithm is employed with random restars. Numerical examples show the efficiency of the heuristic especially in networks with nonhomogeneous fiber quality.

AB  - The identification and characterization of traffic anomalies on massive road networks is a vital component of traffic monitoring and control. Anomaly identification can be used to reduce congestion, increase safety, and provide transportation engineers with better information for traffic forecasting and road network design. However, because of the size, complexity, and dynamics of transportation networks, automating such a process is challenging. A multidimensional mining framework is proposed; it can be used to identify a concise set of anomalies from massive traffic monitoring data and then overlay, contrast, and explore such anomalies in multidimensional space. The framework is based on the development of two novel methods: (1) efficient anomaly mining stemming from the discovery of the atypical fragment (a compact representation of a set of abnormal traffic patterns happening across a sequence of connected road segments, possibly spanning multiple roads, and occurring at overlapping time intervals) and (2) a multidimensional anomaly overlay model that enables the clustering of multiple atypical fragments according to different criteria (e.g., severity, topology, or spatiotemporal characteristics). The atypical fragment provides a concise, global view of the traffic anomaly situation, whereas the framework for anomaly overlay provides the power of online analytical processing to facilitate the discovery of patterns associated with different anomaly types and the navigation of anomalies at multilevel abstraction.

AB  - Forecasting of general packet radio service (GPRS) traffic directly influences the future development of 3rd-generation (3G) ervice of telecommunications enterprises. According to the complexity and non-linearity of GPRS traffic. In this paper, Firstly the schaotic feature of GPRS traffic is verified with chaos theory. It can be seen that GPRS traffic possesses chaotic features, providing a basis for performing short-term forecast of GPRS traffic with the help of chaos theory. The average mutual information (AMI) method is used to find the optimal time lag of the series. Cao's method is adopted to determine free parameters of support vector machines. Additionally, the proposed model was tested on the prediction of GPRS traffic of Chongqing province telecommunications operator in China to prove the model's validity. © 2010 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications.

AB  - Analysis of historical air traffic is used to determine trends that will assist in traffic forecasting. This process begins with externally supplied forecasts that use econometrics as a base to produce passengers and movements as an output, which is then refined through the results of traffic analysis. The paper begins by defining the service charge structure for Nav Canada and defines two main service charges, one related to departures from Canadian airports and one related to the distance traveled by these flights. From the defined markets, domestic, transborder, south, Atlantic, and Pacific monthly growth rates are examined for potential trends. Although frequency may be a primary driver underlying much of the growth, the service charge structure includes the components of aircraft size (weight) and distance, factors that are not included in external forecasts. The paper presents the growth rates of all three components (frequency, aircraft size, and distance) within these markets to identify potential areas for further analysis and then examines the domestic market in more detail to determine the causes of traffic changes and their impact on a forecast on a month-by-month basis. This analysis also reveals further questions and identifies the need for additional analytical techniques.

AB  - Accurate and timely forecasting of traffic parameters is crucial for effective management of intelligent transportation systems. Travel time index (TTI) is a fundamental measure in transportation. In this article, a non-parametric technique called least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) is proposed to forecast TTI. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to cooperate the rising computational intelligence technique with state space approach in traffic forecasting. Five other baseline predictors are selected for comparison purposes because of their proved effectiveness. Having good generalisation ability and guaranteeing global minima, LS-SVMs perform better than the others. Experimental results demonstrate that our predictor can significantly reduce mean absolute percentage errors and variance of absolute percentage errors, especially for predicting traffic data with weak regularity. Persuasive comparisons clearly show that it provides a large improvement in stability and robustness, which reveals that it is a promising approach in traffic forecasting and time series analysis. © 2009 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

AB  - Short-term forecasting of travel time is essential for the success of intelligent transportation system. In this paper, we review the state-of-art of short-term traffic forecasting models and outline their basic ideas, related works, advantages and disadvantages of each model. An improved adaptive exponential smoothing (IAES) model is also proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the previous adaptive exponential smoothing model. Then, comparing experiments are carried out under normal traffic condition and abnormal traffic condition to evaluate the performance of four main branches of forecasting models on direct travel time data obtained by license plate matching (LPM). The results of experiments show each model seems to have its own strength and weakness. The forecasting performance of IASE is superior to other models in shorter forecasting horizon (one and two step forecasting) and the IASE is capable of dealing with all kind of traffic conditions.

AB  - Five mechanisms are examined by which traffic-controlled intersections can interact within a long-range traffic forecast, and the computational implications of each are explored. These mechanisms apply to networks that can adapt to changing travel behaviors over a long period of time. One mechanism relates to user-optimal equilibrium traffic assignment, which is a prerequisite for the remaining four: the chopping of traffic streams by signals, the smoothing of traffic streams by signs or meters, progressive signalization, and deployment of newly warranted traffic control devices. The inclusion of nodal interactions in traffic forecasts can substantially improve the precision of traffic forecasts but may require a very large increase in computational effort.

AB  - Optimization of air traffic flow in the National Airspace System is, by nature, a large-scale problem, the solving of which usually requires intensive computation. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming method to solve a nationwide air traffic flow management problem based on an aggregate air traffic model. A dual decomposition methodisappliedto solve the large-scale traffic management problem, where the nationwide problem is decomposed pathbypath into 1000sof subproblems that are solved independently. Itisshowninthis paper that the solution with the dual decomposition method converges to the global optimum. The major contribution of the proposed modeling and optimization framework is that it is about 6 times faster than a previously developed large-capacity cell transmission model. It is also shown that the proposed optimization method obtains an equally optimal solution as the large-capacity cell transmission model. In the meantime, the proposed model is capable of including both ground delay and airborne delay, while the large-capacity cell transmission model includes airborne delay only. The traffic forecasting capability of the new model is also examined statistically at the sector level and the national level. It is shown that the sector counts are predicted with relative errors of less than 20% for over 80% of the high-altitude sectors in the United States. Further analysis also suggests that the accuracy of the proposed model is comparable with the other two aggregate models in the literature.

AB  - Short-term traffic forecasting is playing an increasing role in modern transport management. Although many short-term traffic forecasting methods have been explored, the spatiotemporal dependency of traffic flow, an important characteristic of traffic dynamics that can benefit the forecasting of traffic changes, is often neglected in short-term traffic forecasting. This paper first investigates the spatiotemporal dependency of traffic flow using cross-correlation analysis and then discusses its implications in terms of traffic forecastability and real-time data effectiveness. This can help us to understand traffic flow, and hence improve the performance of forecasting models. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.

AB  - Uncertainty on traffic forecasts may have an impact on reimbursement scheduling for investment, as well as for scenarios for operating costs. Even the best projections are based on models and assumptions, thus raising the question of their accuracy. Indeed, long term investments are risky and it is important to cope with uncertainty. This paper deals with the uncertainty on a long term projection with an Age-Cohort approach. we used the jackknife technique to estimate confidence intervals and observe that the demographic approach outlines the structural determinants for long term trends of mobility.

AB  - This article presents three methods to forecast accurately the amount of traffic in TCP/IP based networks: a novel neural network ensemble approach and two important adapted time series methods (ARIMA and Holt-Winters). In order to assess their accuracy, several experiments were held using real-world data from two large Internet service providers. In addition, different time scales (5 min, 1 h and 1 day) and distinct forecasting lookaheads were analysed. The experiments with the neural ensemble achieved the best results for 5 min and hourly data, while the Holt-Winters is the best option for the daily forecasts. This research opens possibilities for the development of more efficient traffic engineering and anomaly detection tools, which will result in financial gains from better network resource management. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Current air traffic forecast methods employed by the United States Federal Aviation Administration function under the assumption that the structure of the network of routes operated by airlines will not change; that is, no new routes will be added nor existing ones removed. However, in reality the competitive nature of the airline industry is such that new routes are routinely added between cities possessing significant passenger demand; city-pairs are also removed. Such phenomena generates a gap between the forecasted and actual state of the US Air Transportation System in the long term, providing insufficient situational awareness to major stakeholders and decision-makers in their consideration of major policy and technology changes. To address this gap, we have developed and compared three algorithms that forecast the likelihood of un-connected city-pairs being connected by service in the future, primarily based on the nodal characteristics of airports in the US network. Validation is performed by feeding historical data to each algorithm and then comparing the accuracy and precision of new city-pairs forecasted using knowledge of actual new city-pairs that developed. While an Artificial Neural Network produces superior precision, fitness function and logistic regression algorithms provide good representation of the distribution of new route types as well as greater flexibility for modeling future scenarios. However, these latter two algorithms face difficulty in resolving differences among the large number of 'spoke' airports in the network - additional parameters that may be able to differentiate them are currently under review. These insights gained are valuable stepping stones for exploiting knowledge of restructuring in the service route network to improve overall forecasts that drive policy and technology decision-making. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes annual average daily traffic (AADT) forecasting for the Lithuanian highways using a forecasting method used by Idaho Department for Transportation, growth factor, linear regression and multiple regression. AADT forecasts obtained using these methods are compared with the forecasts evaluated by traffic experts and given in references. The results show that the best Lithuanian traffic data are obtained using Idaho forecasting method. It is assumed that the curve of AADT change should be exponential in the future.

AB  - Congestion is already severe and projected to worsen in U.S. metro areas. Few current long-range transportation plans call for reducing congestion. Yet the costs congestion imposes make reducing it imperative. Capacity additions are a key part of reducing congestion. We estimate nationwide capacity needs to keep volume/capacity below 1.0 and thus avoid severe congestion over the next 25 years and the costs of building the new capacity. We then examine a set of specific capacity additions in Atlanta and establish how tolling parts of the system can help pay for much of its costs.

AB  - Lots of works have been done for the self-similarity of ethernet and world wide web traffic. In this letter, we study the ad hoc wireless network traffic collected in ad hoc network (AHN) testbed and show that the ad hoc wireless network traffic are self-similar, which validate that AHN traffic is forecastable because self-similar time-series can be forecasted. We apply a fuzzy logic system to ad hoc wireless network traffic forecasting and simulation results show that it performs much better than does an LMS adaptive filter. All these studies are very important for evaluating network capacity and determining the battery power mode based on the forecasted traffic workload.

AB  - This paper studies the proliferation of toll roads delivered under the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) structure. It proposes to disentangle the intricate web of contractual relationships to examine the underlying objectives of certain PPP toll roads in the Australian state of New South Wales, and the effectiveness of their contractual and financial mechanisms in incentivising risk undertaking. At the aggregate level, PPP toll roads were implemented to induce the private participation in road operations with the view of gradually fulfilling the objective of cost savings to governments. This effort to entice the private sector has led to consistent erroneous traffic forecasts across projects. Although there have been noticeable advancements in contract design and incentive mechanisms to optimise the allocation of risks to the public and private sectors, PPP toll roads have yet to deliver optimal results. PPPs present a unique compounded agency problem. They have enabled governments to escape from public accountability and diluted the imperative of public interest consideration. The under-investigated public perception of PPP toll roads offers a scope for future research.

AB  - The traffic to be carried by today's European backbone networks increases very rapidly. An important portion of this traffic consists of data traffic (mainly IP-related). In the future data traffic is expected to become the abundantly dominant traffic type, while voice traffic will only account for a very small portion of the total traffic volume. In this paper, some network topologies for such a pan-European fiber-optic backbone network are presented (more details can be found in [1]). These topologies are compared in terms of the efficiency of the network design both from a cost and capacity point of view and in terms of the availability of the connections routed over this network. In order to be able to assess the network topologies under realistic circumstances, the expected traffic demand is forecasted. This enables to make the comparison for the current traffic volume as well as for the traffic patterns of the future. As not all types of (data) traffic require the same degree of survivability and in order to leverage the total capacity cost of the network design, a distinction is made between different recovery options in the optical layer for the different traffic types considered.

AB  - A search based heuristic for the optimisation of communication networks where traffic forecasts are uncertain and the problem is NP-complete is presented. While algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) are often used for this class of problem, this work applies a combination of newer optimisation techniques specifically: fast local search (FLS) as an improved hill climbing method and guided local search (GLS) to allow escape from local minima. The GLS + FLS combination is compared with an optimised GA and SA approaches. It is found that in terms of implementation, the parameterisation of the GLS + FLS technique is significantly simpler than that for a GA and SA. Also, the self-regularisation feature of the GLS + FLS approach provides a distinctive advantage over the other techniques which require manual parameterisation. To compare numerical performance, the three techniques were tested over a number of network sets varying in size, number of switch circuit demands (network bandwidth demands) and levels of uncertainties on the switch circuit demands. The results show that the GLS + FLS outperforms the GA and SA techniques in terms of both solution quality and optimisation speed but even more importantly GLS + FLS has significantly reduced parameterisation time. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conventionally, most traffic forecasting models have been applied in a static framework in which new observations are not used to update model parameters automatically. The need to perform periodic parameter reestimation at each forecast location is a major disadvantage of such models. From a practical standpoint, the usefulness of any model depends not only on its accuracy but also on its ease of implementation and maintenance. This paper presents an adaptive parameter estimation methodology for univariate traffic condition forecasting through use of three well-known filtering techniques: the Kalman filter, recursive least squares, and least mean squares. Results show that forecasts obtained from recursive adaptive filtering methods are comparable with those from maximum likelihood estimated models. The adaptive methods deliver this performance at a significantly lower computational cost As recursive, self-tuning predictors, the adaptive filters offer plug-and-play capability ideal for implementation in real-time management and control systems. The investigation presented in this paper also demonstrates the robustness and stability of the seasonal time series model underlying the adaptive filtering techniques.

AB  - While vehicular congestion is very often defined in terms of aggregate parameters, such as traffic volume and lane occupancies, based on recent findings, the interpretation that receives most credit is that of a state of a road where traversing vehicles experience a delay exceeding the maximum value typically incurred under light or free-flow traffic conditions. We here propose a new definition according to which a road is in a congested state (be it high or low) only when the likelihood of finding it in the same congested state is high in the near future. Based on this new definition, we devised an algorithm that, exploiting probe vehicles, for any given road 1) identifies if it is congested or not and 2) provides the estimation that a current congested state will last for at least a given time interval. Unlike any other existing approach, an important advantage of ours is that it can generally be applied to any type of road, as it neither needs any a priori knowledge nor requires the estimation of any road parameter (e.g., number of lanes, traffic light cycle, etc.). Further, it allows performing short-term traffic congestion forecasting for any given road. We present several field trials gathered on different urban roads whose empirical results confirm the validity of our approach. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate and timely traffic forecasting is crucial to effective management of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). To predict travel time index (TTI) data, we select six baseline individual predictors as basic combination components. Applying the one-step-ahead out-of-sample forecasts, the paper proposes several linear combined forecasting techniques. States of traffic situations are classified into peak and non-peak periods. Based on detailed data analyses, some practical guidance and comments are given in what situation a combined model is better than an individual model or other types of combined models. Indicating which model is more appropriate in each state, persuasive comparisons demonstrate that the combined procedures can significantly reduce forecast error rates. It reveals that the approaches are practically promising in the field. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to systematically investigate these approaches in peak and non-peak traffic forecasts. The studies can provide a reference for optimal forecasting model selection in each period. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - As wireless operators look for new revenue opportunities to justify their investment in third-generation equipment, multimedia services appear to offer the best possibility of satisfying their needs. The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), driven by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project/3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP/3GPP2) and based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), provides a basis for delivering these next-generation services. In this paper, we present a detailed model of the IMS services that are being considered for implementation in 3GPP. We also analyze architecture options for both existing and new operators and use a network model to investigate the economic viability of IMS deployment. We compare the pros and cons of implementing multimedia services with and without IMS. Finally, we present a case study - based on the network of a third-generation (3G) wireless service provider - that describes the design of the network, considers the impact of IMS services on its capacity, and offers an economic analysis of the network that takes into account traffic forecasts, standards evolution, and product roadmaps. © 2004 Lucent Technologies Inc.

AB  - With fast proliferation of QoS-enabled wireless packet networks, need for effective QoS control is increasing. In this paper, we focus on QoS provisioning in Mobile WiMAX access service network (ASN). We investigate a dynamic bandwidth provisioning method that can help to increase resource utilization. Our approach consists of two stages: traffic forecasting, followed by bandwidth provisioning. For the first stage, we use auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast traffic based on online measurement. For the second stage, we use a bandwidth provisioning scheme that allocates bandwidths depending on the traffic forecasting. We modeled our problem as a Fractional Knapsack Problem for which we used a greedy algorithm in order to find an approximate solution. Through simulation studies with real-world data sets, we found that our approach could increase the bandwidth for the real-time traffic class and guarantee adequate service quality for the nonreal-time traffic class as well, while maximizing resource utilization. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Network providers are often interested in providing dynamically provisioned bandwidth to customers based on periodically measured nonstationary traffic while meeting service level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we propose a dynamic bandwidth provisioning framework for such a situation. In order to have a good sense of nonstationary periodically measured traffic data, measurements were first collected over a period of three weeks excluding the weekends in three different months from an Internet access link. To characterize the traffic data rate dynamics of these data sets, we develop a seasonal AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) based model with the innovation process (disturbances) generalized to the class of heavy-tailed distributions. We observed a strong empirical evidence for the proposed model. Based on the ARCH-model, we present a probability-hop forecasting algorithm, an augmented forecast mechanism using the confidence-bounds of the mean forecast value from the conditional forecast distribution. For bandwidth estimation, we present different bandwidth provisioning schemes that allocate or deallocate the bandwidth based on the traffic forecast generated by our forecasting algorithm. These provisioning schemes are developed to allow trade off between the underprovisioning and the utilization, while addressing the overhead cost of updating bandwidth. Based on extensive studies with three different data sets, we have found that our approach provides a robust dynamic bandwidth provisioning framework for real-world periodically measured nonstationary traffic. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes a holistic capacity planning methodology for radio access networks (RANs) and presents a case study focusing on the third generation (3G) code division multiple access (CDMA) technology. It addresses the complex problem of how a RAN should be optimally and justin-time equipped to accommodate fluctuations in traffic patterns over time, while fulfilling the quality of service (QoS) requirements of a wireless network operator (WNO) and without over-provisioning. The just-in-time RAN capacity planning methodology provides a software engine that automatically and iteratively computes various RAN configurations (which may correspond to various "what-if" deployment scenarios) based on multiple inputs that include network configuration, traffic volume measurements, and traffic forecast. It uses a bottom-up approach that sequentially evaluates the capacity needs over the air interface, at the base stations, and over the transport (backhaul) domain. Material in excess/deficit is identified at each RAN level and may be redistributed to avoid ordering of new material and reduce overall cost. This methodology provides the rapid and repeatable dimensioning which is required to implement just-in-time provisioning processes, and to support the network cost modeling an operator requires to quickly model quality of service and call plan strategy. Furthermore, thanks to its high level of automation, it allows the WNOs to complete a multi-year capacity planning process quickly and efficiently. The approach uses a generic process enabling its applicability to any CDMA-based network. It has been intensively tested with real field data and has been recently adopted by several WNOs. © 2008 Alcatel-Lucent.

AB  - One of the key functions of traffic management systems is to monitor traffic conditions and detect the presence of conditions that are abnormal or may not be expected. As archiving of traffic data becomes less costly and more commonplace, generation of short-term forecasts of traffic conditions in real-time conditions is also becoming increasingly possible. Use of condition monitoring information can enhance the performance of short-term traffic forecasting procedures. In this study, one of the most studied approaches to forecasting, the nearest neighbor form of nonparametric regression, is coupled with a condition monitoring method that characterizes the extent to which current traffic conditions deviate from those that may be expected based on historical data. When the normalcy-based approach to traffic condition monitoring was used in the selection of observations from a traffic data archive and in the determination of the nearness of those observations to the current condition, the mean absolute percentage errors for two of the four nearest neighbor forecasting procedures were reduced. © 2006 ASCE.

AB  - Short-term traffic volume data are characterized by rapid and intense fluctuations with frequent shifts to congestion. Currently, research in short-term traffic forecasting deals with these phenomena either by smoothing them or by accounting for them by nonlinear models. But, these approaches lead to inefficient predictions particularly when the data exhibit intense oscillations or frequent shifts to boundary conditions (congestion). This paper offers a set of tools and methods to assess on underlying statistical properties of short-term traffic volume data, a topic that has largely been overlooked in traffic forecasting literature. Results indicate that the statistical characteristics of traffic volume can be identified from prevailing traffic conditions; for example, volume data exhibit frequent shifts from deterministic to stochastic structures as well as transitions between cyclic and strongly nonlinear behaviors. These findings could be valuable in the implementation of a variable prediction strategy according to the statistical characteristics of the prevailing traffic volume states. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is an important means to facilitate network capacity planning by predicting necessary link upgrades and link additions, but it is generally unable to take into account events that are hard to predict, e.g., breaking news, denial-of-service attacks, and failures. These events, which may be typically short-lived but whose impact on the network traffic load is significant, together with the hard to predict traffic due to the server farm based architecture of the Internet will increase the amount of unpredictable traffic. The so-called network lifetime metric, which measures the ability of a network to sustain unexpected changes and shifts in traffic load, is becoming increasingly important. Very recently reported preliminary results show that the widely deployed bidirectional rings provide the smallest network lifetime, whereas chordal rings perform best in terms of network lifetime. In this paper, we first provide extensive numerical investigations of the network lifetime of bidirectional rings for realistic initial traffic scenarios. We then provide more detailed insights into the network lifetime of chordal rings and show that chordal rings not necessarily outperform bidirectional rings. Finally, we examine meshed rings and a novel hybrid ring-star network which clearly outperform not only bidirectional but also chordal rings in terms of network lifetime for a wide range of unexpected traffic changes and shifts. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate and timely forecasting of traffic status is crucial to effective management of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). An interacting multiple model (IMM) predictor is proposed to forecast travel time index (TTI) data in the letter. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to propose the novel combined predictor. Seven baseline individual predictors are selected as combination components because of their proved effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the IMM predictor can significantly outperform the other predictors and provide a large improvement in stability and robustness. This reveals that the approach is practically promising in traffic forecasting. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - The main difficulty in forecasting traffic volumes in small urban communities is identifying the amount and destination of the external traffic. Three methods exist for determining the percentage of external traffic destined for the study community (external-internal trips) or through the study community (external-external trips): a comprehensive origin-destination study, a cordon line origin-destination study, and the use of regression equations. This paper examines the possibility of the use of an alternative technique, based on a spatial economic model, to determine the traffic distribution. The project uses an economic model, which includes surrounding community factors, to determine the trip rates for three communities within Alabama and compares the results obtained from this model with the results given by a commonly accepted regression equation and a recently completed cordon line origin-destination study performed by using video surveillance. It is demonstrated that the economic model performs well for the case study cities, and this model is recommended for use in providing estimates that incorporate a community's economic relationship to neighboring towns for traffic forecasting.

AB  - The paper presents an analysis of the factors which affect the scaling of quality of service (QoS) solutions. This includes analysis of the sources of variance in traffic forecasts and how these contribute to a probability that a network resource will be unable to meet the capacity load placed upon it. While the analysis is general and could be applied to a wide variety of QoS mechanisms, this paper is focused on the scalability of 'edge connection acceptance control with DiffServ core' networks for real-time services and concludes that this scaling of such networks is remarkably poor. One way of addressing this poor scalability is for operators to lease from other operators what is for them 'virtual infrastructure' in order to construct a network with short topology. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.

AB  - Recently, the forecasting technologies for network traffic have played a significant role in network management, congestion control and network security. Forecasting algorithms have also been investigated for decades along with the development of Time Series Analysis (TSA). Chaotic Time Series Analysis (CTSA) may be used to model and forecast the time series by Chaos Theory. As one of the prevailing intelligent forecasting algorithms, it is worthwhile to integrate CTSA and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this paper, after the vulnerabilities of Local Support Vector Machine (LSVM) in forecasting modeling are analyzed, the Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) and the "Dynamic K" strategy are introduced, as well as a short-term network traffic forecasting algorithm LSVM-DTW-K based on Chaos Theory and SVM is presented. Finally, two sets of network traffic datasets collected from wired and wireless campus networks, respectively, are studied for our experiments. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Although weather, traffic mix and speed variability across lanes are largely considered as significant determinants of traffic flow characteristics on freeways, they have not been incorporated into short-term traffic forecasting models. We evaluate the effects of weather and traffic mix on the predictability of traffic speed using several vector autoregressive moving average models with exogenous variables. Results indicate that including exogenous variables in the forecasting models only marginally improves their prediction performance, while modeling innovations such as Vector and Bayesian estimation improves the models significantly. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The objective of this study is to examine the potential for a full transition to domestically produced biofuels in the Stockholm County transport system in 2030, without exceeding the proportional share of national bioenergy assets. This target is chosen in order to test the potential of biofuel assets in Sweden, facilitating the transition to renewable fuel systems, and to display the potential of transport energy demand at macrolevel under tighter conditions on the energy market after fossil oil production has peaked. The distribution of bioenergy to the transport sector, including conversion losses and relationships to other energy sectors, is analysed explicitly. State-of-the-art traffic forecasting models, complemented with a specially designed energy quantification model, are applied to assess energy quantities needed at different vehicle efficiency levels and mobility patterns. The purpose is not to determine the most energy-efficient transport system possible, or to forecast the optimal distribution of bioenergy set aside for the transport sector in the future. Rather, we try to visualise, at a more conceptual level, energy demand as dependent on principle transport strategies, future technological developments and a type of planning that takes technological interlinkages between evolving components into strategic account. This work highlights the importance of implementing both demand and supply-side policies in order to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in all energy sectors before making assessments of reasonable distributions of bioenergy between energy sectors and other biomass usage. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A short-term, real-time system was developed to support traffic management in Beijing. The requirements of a large amount of data and unstable traffic flow are the biggest challenges to such a system. The models and software framework thus should be effective enough to face these problems. The core of such a system is the short-term traffic flow forecast model. Rapid urbanization and transportation development in Beijing have led to traffic flow patterns with some unstable characteristics. The short-term forecast model for an online system thus was designed with the fast-paced trend in mind. The model considers historical data, real-time data, and space data, and it can be updated online. Thus a combined model was developed with three submodels: discrete Fourier transform model, autoregressive model, and neighborhood regression model. Weights of each submodel were based on forecast error. Both the historical forecast error and real-time forecast error were considered. The system was built on a browser-server structure to support combined forecast models. The framework, modules, and interface of this system are introduced in this paper.

AB  - Taxi drivers drive on the roads every day and become very knowledgeable of the spatiotemporal traffic patterns in a city. It therefore is reasonable to assume that the routes chosen by taxi drivers often work out better than those selected by other drivers. Since dynamic navigation assistance based on real-time traffic information faces limitations such as the spatial coverage of real-time data collection sites, performance of real-time data processing and communications, and accuracy of short-term traffic forecasts in a large urban area, experiences gained by taxi drivers can be a valuable data source for improving the quality of vehicle navigation guidance. This paper develops a vehicle navigation guidance system based on taxis drivers' knowledge derived from floating car data collected over an extended time period. We then classify road segments based on the spatiotemporal characteristics of taxi tracking data. A case study using taxi tracking data collected in Wuhan, China is presented in this paper to demonstrate the performance of this vehicle navigation system based on taxi tracking data. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - This paper focuses on analyzing traffic facilities for an intermediate time frame. There are two methodologies examined in this work, the first uses extrapolated, historical traffic count data and the second uses an urban transportation model. Using several intersections within Huntsville, Ala., as case study intersection locations, this paper applies both methodologies to forecast near-future traffic and compares the forecasted results with the actual traffic counts to determine which methodology better replicated actual volumes. The results of this work indicate that a properly validated and applied urban transportation planning model has the ability to provide more accurate traffic forecasts to support the traffic engineering analysis decision than the commonly used extrapolated traffic trends. © ASCE.

AB  - This paper intends to describe the relationship between traffic parameters by using cusp catastrophe theory and to deduce highway capacity and corresponding speed forecasting value through suitable transformation of catastrophe model. The five properties of a catastrophe system are outlined briefly, and then the data collected on freeways of Zhujiang River Delta, Guangdong province, China are examined to ascertain whether they exhibit qualitative properties and attribute of the catastrophe model. The forecasting value of speed and capacity for freeway segments are given based on the catastrophe model. Furthermore, the speed-flow curve on freeway is drawn by plotting out congested and uncongested traffic flow and the capacity value for the same freeway segment is also obtained from speed-flow curve to test the feasibility of the application of cusp catastrophe theory in traffic flow analysis. The calculating results of catastrophe model coincide with those of traditional traffic flow models regressed from field observed data, which indicates that the deficiency of traditional analysis of relationship between speed, flow and occupancy in two-dimension can be compensated by analysis of the relationship among speed, flow and occupancy based on catastrophe model in three-dimension. Finally, the prospects and problems of its application in traffic flow research in China are discussed.

AB  - The latest generations of telecommunications networks have been designed to deliver high data rates, providing flexible communication capabilities that can enable high-quality video images. However, these new generations of telecommunications networks are interference-limited, impairing their performance in cases of heavy traffic and high usage. One way to lift this constraint would be for the mobile telecommunications network operators to obtain the cooperation of a broadcast network operator so that at times when the service demand is too high, the service can be transferred to the broadcast network. This paper proposes a way for UMTS network operators to forecast the traffic associated with high-demand services intended to be deployed on the UMTS network and when demand requires to transfer it to a cooperating DVB-T network. The paper aims to justify cooperation between UMTS and DVB-T networks clearly showing how using a DVB-T network as a support to UMTS can increase the revenue generated by both networks.

AB  - In order to forecast the future growth of the network, it is necessary to predict the numbers of subscribers in different categories, during the period concerned. The number of subscribers and traffic are determined in two manners in general: by recording the number of calls in the digital exchange itself, or by demographic and socio-economic analysis of the population. A great number of repeated requests occur in periods of peak traffic intensity. That is the reason, why the total number of calls registered at the digital exchange gives an uncorrect image of the number of real callers. This paper seeks to provide the new method based on the relationship established between the statistical number of calls registered in the digital exchange and the real number of callers. The proposed method is the convenient way for a quick and precise acquisition of necessary data for further prognoses.

AB  - "Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future." Niels Bohr The pace at which new technologies are assimilated into society is driven by trends in the regulatory, budgetary, and societal environments in addition to the pace of technology development itself. This study merges trends in these areas to develop an integrated forecast of the levels to which unmanned aviation can be expected to emerge in the military, air cargo, business, general aviation, and airline aviation segments over the coming 40 years. One out of every 80 aircraft on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan over the US are anticipated in this forecast to be unmanned by 2025 and two out of nine (18 of every 80) by 2050. Portions of this study were originally researched in 2005 in support of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) for planning the Next Generation (NextGen) air traffic system and later presented at the 23rd Bristol UAV Systems Conference.

AB  - We introduce a methodology to predict when and where link additions/ upgrades have to take place in an Internet protocol (IP) backbone network. Using simple network management protocol (SNMP) statistics, collected continuously since 1999, we compute aggregate demand between any two adjacent points of presence (PoPs) and look at its evolution at time scales larger than 1 h. We show that IP backbone traffic exhibits visible long term trends, strong periodicities, and variability at multiple time scales. Our methodology relies on the wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA) and linear time series models. Using wavelet MRA, we smooth the collected measurements until we identify the overall long-term trend. The fluctuations around the obtained trend are further analyzed at multiple time scales. We show that the largest amount of variability in the original signal is due to its fluctuations at the 12-h time scale. We model inter-PoP aggregate demand as a multiple linear regression model, consisting of the two identified components. We show that this model accounts for 98% of the total energy in the original signal, while explaining 90% of its variance. Weekly approximations of those components can be accurately modeled with low-order autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. We show that forecasting the long term trend and the fluctuations of the traffic at the 12-h time scale yields accurate estimates for at least 6 months in the future. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The most up-to-date annual average daily traffic (AADT) is always required for transport model development and calibration. However, the current-year AADT data are not always available. The short-term traffic flow forecasting models can be used to predict the traffic flows for the current year. In this paper, two non-parametric models, non-parametric regression (NPR) and Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML), are chosen for short-term traffic forecasting based on historical data collected for the annual traffic census (ATC) in Hong Kong. These models are adapted as they are more flexible and efficient in forecasting the daily vehicular flows in the Hong Kong ATC core stations (in total of 87 stations). The daily vehicular flows predicted by these models are then used to calculate the AADT of the current year, 1999. The overall prediction and comparison results show that the NPR model produces better forecasts than the GML model using the ATC data in Hong Kong. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The paper aims at presenting the application of the time series method as one of the quantitative methods used in cargo traffic farecast. Considering the importance of the North Adriatic traffic route, the forecast is made for dry cargo and is referring to the ports of Rijeka, Koper and Trieste. In such a way the future potential cargo gravitating towards this traffic route has been assessed. Besides the competition that exists among these ports, the need is being felt on the world maritime market today for these three main North Adriatic ports to cooperate in order to be able to compete with the ports of the north-west European and Black Sea traffic route. The values obtained for the predicted cargo traffic are evaluated favourably. However, it is necessary to include other forecasting methods in further researches, as they will take into consideration other factors and not only the movement of traffic in the passed period of time.

AB  - The hybrid linear and nonlinear modeling framework has been widely used as a promising method for time series forecasting. However, there have been very few, if any, large scale comparative studies for the hybrid linear and nonlinear framework for air passenger traffic forecasting. So, we hope this study would fill this gap. The linear models selected are autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (SARIMA). As for the nonlinear models, support vector machines (SVMs) and multi-layer feed-forward neural networks (FNN) are selected. Specifically, we employ these models on the four monthly air passenger traffic series of American airlines. The results demonstrate that significant improvement can be achieved with hybrid linear and nonlinear framework, particularly, hybrid framework combined by SARIMA and SVM models performed best in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), multiple comparisons with the best (MCB), and fraction best (FRAC-BEST).

AB  - The development of the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) Pavement Loading Guide (PLG) was initiated to improve the reliability of traffic load estimates for the LTPP sections that do not have measured axle load data. The PLG contains extensive traffic data obtained from the LTPP database that may constitute the best available source of traffic data at the national level, a user-friendly graphical interface, and guidelines intended to help the user with the development of axle load spectra. Because of these features, the PLG will also facilitate traffic projections for general pavement design and management purposes. The uncertainty associated with estimating annual axle load spectra was quantified by assuming that the measured data do not exist and must be estimated. The estimated data were obtained by using axle load spectra obtained at similar sites in the same jurisdiction and utilized prototype PLG software. The difference between the estimated and the measured traffic loads was quantified by expressing axle load spectra in terms of equivalent single-axle loads. The results show that reasonable traffic load estimates can be obtained by judiciously selecting replacement traffic data. Although the PLG can reduce uncertainty of traffic forecasts and facilitate traffic forecasting, surrogate data can never replace site-specific data.

Besides its prediction accuracy is testified and the model is proved much better than conventional forecasting methods. According to the regional traffic system, the model perfectly states the complex non-linear relation of the traffic and the local social economy. The model also efficiently deals with the system lack of enough data.

AB  - There are some basic problems of transportation research that, for many reasons, should be termed bottleneck problems. The terms "behavioral relevance" and "prediction of behavior" indicate that a description of behavior must reflect actual behavior. This is necessary for a description that can contribute to predicting behavioral patterns. These predictions, in turn, are essential to most transportation studies that involve human behavior. The following bottleneck problems are discussed in detail: behavior-relevant private car costs; behavior-relevant time costs; generalized costs and cost-benefit analysis; attitude surveys and self-knowledgeability; forecasting history versus forecasting the future; and indirect effects and the perfect traffic forecast. All these problems are much too important to be solved by sweeping them under the carpet - which in many ways is what we are doing now.

AB  - A radial basis function (RBF) neural network has recently been applied to time-series forecasting. The test results of an RBF neural network in forecasting short-term freeway traffic volumes are provided. Real observations of freeway traffic volumes from the San Antonio TransGuide System have been used in these experiments. For comparison of forecasting performances, Taylor series, exponential smoothing method (ESM), double exponential smoothing method, and backpropagation neural network were also designed and tested. The RBF neural network model provided the best performance and required less computational time than BPN. It seems that RBF and ESM can be a viable forecasting routine for advanced traffic management systems. There are some tradeoffs between RBF and ESM. Although the performance of ESM is inferior to RBF, the former does not need a complicated training process or historic database, and vice versa. However, even in the best performance case, 35 percent of the forecast traffic volumes showed 10 percent or more percentage errors. This means that we cannot heavily depend on the forecast traffic volumes as long as we are utilizing the models tested. Further work is needed to provide a more reliable traffic forecasting model.

AB  - Access to the port of Antwerp in Belgium is provided through locks connecting the river with the docks. The decision to build a container quay on the river, outside the port, will hinder through traffic. A simulation model is built to investigate the hindrance of the river quay. Detailed modelling of maritime traffic on the river, including navigation logic, tides and lock planning, are included. Simulation experiments are run based both on current real-life measurements and on traffic forecasts. The model is built and implemented in such a way that it is reusable and extendible for future decisions on infrastructure improvements or maintenance projects. © 1998, Sage Publications.

AB  - New telecom services demand/traffic forecasting and planning tasks are often quite complicated and surrounded by uncertainty because of their structural complexity and lack of (sufficient) historical data. The contention of this paper is that these tasks can and should be performed in a more careful and structured manner using the subjective knowledge of experts/managers, structured scenario analysis, and that different sorts of imprecision/ uncertainty/risk associated with new telecom forecasting and planning can be discriminated, described in a structured way and quantified. Several new concepts in demand/traffic forecasting and planning have been introduced and appropriate computer tools developed. These tools are general enough to accept crisp and soft inputs (e.g. verbally expressed expert opinions) and allow formal problem specification, selection and analysis of alternatives, translation between different ways of expression and analysis of decision consequences. © 1990.

AB  - Knowledge of future traffic flow is an essential input in the planning, implementation and development of a transportation system. It also helps in its operation, management and control. Time series analysis techniques have been extensively adopted for this purpose in the fields of economics, social sciences and in other fields of technology. An attempt has been made in this study to apply the techniques of time series analysis to goods traffic, particularly truck traffic. Four predominant corridors, N.H.3, N.H.4, N.H.8 and Lal Bahadur Shastri Road (L.B. S. Rd.), accounting for majority of truck movement in the Bombay Metropolitan Region (BMR), have been considered for modeling. Raw data was processed initially, to obtain an insight into the structure of time series. Ten candidate models of the Auto‐Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) and Auto‐Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) family are investigated to represent each of the four corridors. Models finally proposed, to represent each of the four corridors have been selected based on Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) and Maximum Likelihood Rule (MLR) criteria. Models ARIMA (2, 1, 0), ARMA (1.0), ARMA (1, 1) and ARIMA (1, 1, 0) are proposed for N.H.3, N.H.4, N.H.8 and L.B.S. Rd. respectively, based on significant weekly periodicity.

AB  - For the second time within 5 years, the traffic forecasting model application developed by the planning staff for the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, area metropolitan planning organization (MPO) has achieved not only a base-year accuracy that exceeds what other, larger MPOs have accomplished, but also a travel-volume and travel-time accuracy for the relatively high-volume streets that, in most cases, is not significantly different from the sampling error of field observations. Comparable success has also been achieved in modeling peak-hour traffic patterns, where applications have also been developed to model peak-hour factoring and design hour volumes for transportation projects. The standard of accuracy that has been achieved for this metro area has been made possible by two major differences from typical MPO practice. First, travel estimates (trip generation rates) are based on field-measured vehicle-trip rates rather than the common practice of a stated-response travel survey of the public (i.e., on what people do rather than what they say they do). Second, and far more important, the modeling is based on the dynamic integration of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methods of intersection traffic control analysis with traditional traffic forecasting processes. Although there are many planning agencies that claim to be using HCM procedures, the process described is shown to be the one that much more faithfully replicates the flexible approach capacities and volume/delay relationships that are the direct result of HCM-level analysis.

AB  - An important issue in the design of a transport planning study is the level of aggregation that is selected for the measurement of data. Clearly, some data items give a better return on the investment of effort in increasing their accuracy: the problem is to optimise the return on the investment of a fixed budget over all the data to be collected. This paper addresses the problem of determining appropriate levels of data aggregation for two key travel demand forecasting models: those predicting destination choice (or trip distribution) and mode choice. These choice processes may be treated either separately or, as is now becoming more common, in a joint modelling procedure. They have been chosen for study in this paper because of their intrinsic importance and because of the availability of results from a number of studies that serve to illustrate key points. The objective of the paper is to provide indications for the practitioner for appropriate aggregation levels to be used in empirical studies. -from Authors

AB  - The planning, design and construction of new roads in urban areas is no longer a matter of traffic forecasts, highway design and road construction. The socio-economic and particularly the environmental impact of a new road on the urban area has become a crucial factor in the planning process. The Paper discusses several examples of new roads, in urban areas in the Netherlands. The first example is used to indicate the criteria that were taken into account in the planning and design of a motorway in the northern part of the Netherlands. The second example describes the design of an arterial road in a new development near Amsterdam. Finally, information is given on the research and development of criteria to improve the environment of existing roads in urban areas.

AB  - The problem of determining the number and placement of signals on traffic networks for long-range urban travel forecasting is addressed. An algorithm for determining the signalization strategy was developed and given a large-scale test on the network for a metropolitan area of about 150,000 people. The algorithm attempts to mimic the actions of traffic engineers as they make adjustment to the traffic system over a long period of time. Tests indicate that the algorithm produces a network that closely approximates one that has been optimized for vehicle hours traveled but still respects safety and fairness issues. The algorithm is highly computational, so limits needed to be arbitrarily placed on the precision of the traffic forecast, the precision of optimization steps, and the number of intermediate forecast years.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for on-line simulations and predictions of traffic states in large-scale networks, which is based on the combination of real-world traffic data with an agent-based traffic flow model. The system is applied to the urban road network of Duisburg and the freeway network of North Rhine-Westphalia. On the basis of historical traffic demand data heuristics are derived, which are combined with the current data to provide a short-term traffic forecast. Additionally, the demand for an anticipatory traffic forecast, which includes decision-making and route choice behaviour of the road users, is discussed. © Oldenbourg Verlag.

AB  - An n-step ahead Robust Sequential Projection Algorithm - Robust SPA -, used for traffic forecast as well as for long term network planning is proposed. The algorithm uses the State Space Model with the state transition matrix being estimated by a relaxation technique. This lightly increases its complexity, as compared to a similar algorithm proposed in the literature, but renders the Robust SPA a better performance. The algorithm is also compared with the Expectation-Maximization technique and, in general, the Robust SPA yields a slightly poorer performance as far as the mean square error between projected and observed data is concerned. On the other hand, it is more robust and requires far less computational effort. Moreover, due to its simplicity, an automated version of the algorithm can be easily implemented for applications in which a great deal of data is to be forecasted.

AB  - Accurate short-term traffic flow forecasting has become a crucial step in the overall goal of better road network management. Previous research [H. Kirby, M. Dougherty, S. Watson, Should we use neural networks or statistical models for short term motorway traffic forecasting, International Journal of Forecasting 13 (1997) 43-50.] has demonstrated that a straightforward application of neural networks can be used to forecast traffic flows along a motorway link. The objective of this paper is to report on the application and performance of an alternative neural computing algorithm which involves 'sequential or dynamic learning' of the traffic flow process. Our initial work [H. Chen, S. Clark, M.S. Dougherty, S.M. Grant-Muller, Investigation of network performance prediction, Report on Dynamic Neural Network and Performance Indicator development, Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds Technical Note 418, 1998 (unpublished)] was based on simulated data (generated using a Hermite polynomial with random noise) that had a profile similar to that of traffic flows in real data. This indicated the potential suitability of dynamic neural networks with traffic flow data. Using the Kalman filter type network an initial application with M25 motorway flow data suggested that a percentage absolute error (PAE) of approximately 9.5% could be achieved for a network with five hidden units (compared with 11% for the static neural network model). Three different neural networks were trained with all the data (containing an unknown number of incidents) and secondly using data wholly obtained around incidents. Results showed that from the three different models, the 'simple dynamic model' with the first five units fixed (and subsequent hidden units distributed amongst these) had the best forecasting performance. Comparisons were also made of the networks' performance on data obtained around incidents. More detailed analysis of how the performance of the three networks changed through a single day (including an incident) showed that the simple dynamic model again outperformed the other two networks in all time periods. The use of 'piecewise' models (i.e. where a different model is selected according to traffic flow conditions) for data obtained around incidents highlighted good performance again by the simple dynamic network. This outperformed the standard Kalman filter neural network for a medium-sized network and is our overall recommendation for any future application. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores the use of recently developed time series techniques for short term traffic volume forecasts. A data set containing monthly volumes on a freeway segment for the years 1968 through 1976 is used to fit a time series model. The resulting model is used to forecast volumes for the year 1977. The forecast volumes are then compared to actual volumes in 1977. The results of this study indicate that time series techniques can be used to develop highly accurate and inexpensive short term forecasts. A discussion of the ways in which such models can be used to evaluate the effects of policy changes or other outside impacts is included. © 1980 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - After reviewing the problem of short-term traffic forecasting a nonparametric regression method, the fc-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach is suggested as a candidate forecaster that might sidestep some of the problems inherent in parametric forecasting approaches. An empirical study using actual freeway data is devised to test the k-NN approach, and compare it to simple univariate linear time-series forecasts. The k-NN method performed comparably to, but not better than, the linear time-series approach. However, further research is needed to delineate those situations where the k-NN approach may, or may not be, preferable. Particular attention should be focused on whether or not regression methods, which forecast mean values, are appropriate for forecasting the extreme values characteristic of transitions from the uncongested traffic regime to the congested regime. In addition, larger data bases may improve the accuracy of the k-NN method. © ASCE.

AB  - This article describes the efforts of the City of Fremont, California, to quantify the effects of transportation demand management (TDM). The microcomputer traffic forecasting model MINUTP was used to forecast citywide intersection level of service (LOS) with and without a TDM program. The model was developed on a regional scale and includes the City of Fremont as a detailed subarea. The model also includes three major trip purposes: home-based-work (HBW), home-based-other (HBO), and non-home-based (NHB). The model is also capable of forecasting morning peak-hour, afternoon peak-hour, and daily traffic volumes and LOS.

AB  - In this paper we present and review a framework for on-line simulations and predictions which are based on the combination of real-world traffic data and a multi-agent traffic flow model. The agent architecture consists of two layers which distinguish the different tasks that road users have to perform. The framework is applied to the urban road network of Duisburg and the freeway network of North-Rhine Westphalia. On the basis of historical data heuristics are derived, which can be combined with the dynamic data of the simulations to provide a short-term traffic forecast. The necessity for an anticipatory traffic forecast, which includes decision-making and route choice behavior of the road users, is discussed.

AB  - Forecasting the amount of traffic expected to be generated by a proposed new land use or by a change in existing land use is one of the basic tasks of a transportation engineer. The factory outlet center is a new type of land use in the US. As part of a proposed factory outlet center traffic impact study, an extensive data collection program was carried out to better define the travel characteristics of factory outlet centers. Describes five study sites in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, and analyses the data collected from these sites, of driveway volumes, trip generation studies and pass-by traffic. The results are analysed and conclusions are drawn based on the survey findings. -from Authors

AB  - Thanks to the statistical and accounting data recorded by the S. N. C. F. for 1982, the balance sheet for one year's TGV operation has now been compiled. Infrastructure and rolling-stock investments are compared with initial estimates. The traffic pattern on the Sud-Est route is analyzed to evaluate the extra traffic generated by the TGV, and this is then set against the theoretical results obtained with the traffic forecast models used by the S. N. C. F. This is followed by an examination of the revenue and expenditure directly identified with operations. The first year of full operation on the new line in 1984 will see the number of scheduled services more than doubled compared with 1982, and this should produce a positive net result (including depreciation and financial charges) consistent with forecasts, despite the slow-down in consumer spending since 1979.

AB  - Report of a committee reviewing 15 different metropolitan areas' experience. In Southwest Wisconsin forecasts for indivudal counties and for the whole region were too high for population (6.7%) but increased activity rates resulted in an under-forecast of employment (2.8%); vehicle ownership, person trips and vehicle trips were all under-forecast. In Chicago there was a tendency for actual values to fall below forecast. In Spokane there was a tendency to fall below forecast in all variables except in the case of trip rates which were under-forecast: as a consequence the traffic forecasts were closer to the outcome than other variables. The Seattle forecasts (especially as revised) were close to cut-turn but major differences appeared in those counties directly affected by employment in Boeing. In Washington DC forecasts underestimated population growth and vehicle ownership; it also failed to predict the decentralisation of growth in the region. Forecasts for specific facilities underestimated traffic at Dallas Fort-Worth International airport and over estimated BART ridership. -A.M.Hay Wisconsin vehicle ownership person trips vehicle trips Chicago Spokane Seattle Boeing Washington DC Dallas Fort Worth International airport BART ridership

AB  - In this paper we present an application of hybrid neural network approaches and an assessment of the effects of missing data on motorway traffic flow forecasting. Two hybrid approaches are developed using a Self-Organising Map (SOM) to initially classify traffic into different states. The first hybrid approach includes four Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, whilst the second uses two Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) models. It was found that the SOM/ARIMA hybrid approach out-performs all individual ARIMA models, whilst the SOM/MLP hybrid approach achieves superior forecasting performance to all models used in this study, including three naïve models. The effects of different proportions of missing data on Neural Network (NN) performance when forecasting traffic flow are assessed and several initial substitution options to replace missing data are discussed. Overall, it is shown that ARIMA models are more sensitive to the percentage of missing data than neural networks in this context. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2001.

AB  - Little research has been carried out on before-and-after studies of traffic and construction costs in large transportation infrastructure projects. The few studies that do exist show that forecasts of construction costs tend to be underestimated and those of traffic, overestimated. An examination of construction costs and traffic in seven large Danish bridge and tunnel projects indicates that, on average, construction costs were underestimated and traffic was overestimated in the initial phases of planning. This pattern is also found for similar projects in other countries. When the results of all the projects are pooled, it is seen that cost overruns of 50 to 100 percent are common and that overruns above 100 percent are not uncommon. Traffic forecasts that are off by 20 to 60 percent when compared with actual development are frequent in large transportation infrastructure projects. The result of this overoptimism in the initial planning phases is that decisions are based on misleading forecasts that may lead to a misallocation of funds and underperforming projects.

AB  - It has been common for airport traffic forecasts to assume a continuing increase in average aircraft size in the future so that the anticipated growth in passenger demand will not result in a proportional increase in aircraft operations. However, to understand the likely future trends in average aircraft size, as well as strategies that an airport might pursue to encourage airlines to use larger equipment, it is necessary to understand the competitive dynamics of the various markets served by the airport and the factors that determine the size of equipment that airlines will use in those markets. Recent trends in average aircraft size at a major U.S. West Coast airport and the influence of market characteristics on the size of aircraft used in different markets are examined. The changes in the past decade in selected short- and medium-haul markets are analyzed, and the results are presented of a cross-sectional model that estimates the influence of various market characteristics, including air traffic delay levels, on the average size of aircraft deployed in a wide variety of markets throughout the United States. The prospects for airport capacity constraints to influence airlines to make use of larger aircraft are discussed, and the implications for airport strategies to encourage the use of larger aircraft are examined.

AB  - A new traffic forecasting method using state space representation is proposed. By means of a state space model, the forecasting value is sequentially calculated by applying the Kalman filter. However the true traffic structure is not easy to grasp as changes in traffic are largely due to social activities. Experience has shown that economic trends in society also have an influence on traffic. For this reason, the traffic structure becomes too complex to describe changes in traffic by using a single state space model. A multiple state space model is proposed. The multiple state space model is composed of several state space models called sub-models. This model is more easily adaptable to change in the traffic structure than a single state space model. The Bayesian forecasting value is given by the weighted summation for each sub-model forecasting value. The Bayesian posterior probability, which is calculated from the likelihood, is used as the weight of the sub-model. A good fitting sub-model posterior probability increases as the number of observations increases.

AB  - There are some basic problems of transportation research that, for many reasons, should be termed bottleneck problems. The terms `behavioral relevance' and `prediction of behavior' indicate that a description of behavior must reflect actual behavior. This is necessary for a description that can contribute to predicting behavioral patterns. These predictions, in turn, are essential to most transportation studies that involve human behavior. The following bottleneck problems are discussed in detail: behavior-relevant private car costs: behavior-relevant time costs; generalized costs and cost-benefit analysis; attitude surveys and self-knowledgeability; forecasting history versus forecasting the future; and indirect effects and the perfect traffic forecast. All these problems are much too important to be solved by sweeping them under the carpet - which in many ways is what we are doing now.

The paper also attempts to review the evolution of car traffic forecasting, a complicated subject in which most of the research effort has gone into modelling and hence predicting car ownership.

AB  - International telecommunications facilities-both satellite and cable circuits-in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins are characterized by persistent excess capacity. Although some excess is desirable to provide flexibility and protection against system failure, the problem is so great that Intelsat has 100 satellite transponders deemed surplus to international requirements. However, plans are under way for continued expansion of cable and satellite capacity. This article examines why telecommunications organizations are investing in such a seemingly wasteful manner. Three possible explanations are explored: (a) over-optimistic traffic forecasts, (b) market structure and regulatory policy, and (c) inefficient pricing of circuits. © 1987.

AB  - In 1975 the country council took the first steps towards the major redevelopment of the airport and appointed the consultancy arm of the British Airports Authority (BAA) to undertake the first stage of a terminal area development study. Birmingham was subsequently allocated regional airport status under the national airport policy for a variety of reasons. This paper discusses the historical background to the development and studies that were made, including air traffic forecasts, environmental impact, development options, surface access and others. Also discussed are design and organization of the development, including terminal layout, power supply, and cost control.

AB  - This paper discusses an object-oriented neural network model that was developed for predicting short-term traffic conditions on a section of the Pacific Highway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated through a time-lag recurrent network (TLRN) which was developed for predicting speed data up to 15 minutes into the future. The results obtained indicate that the TLRN is capable of predicting speed up to 5 minutes into the future with a high degree of accuracy (90-94%). Similar models, which were developed for predicting freeway travel times on the same facility, were successful in predicting travel times up to 15 minutes into the future with a similar degree of accuracy (93-95%). These results represent substantial improvements on conventional model performance and clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using the object-oriented approach for short-term traffic prediction. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This Special Issue is devoted to the debate surrounding new road development and the now acknowledged inducement of traffic. Over the past 20 yr, conventional appraisal practice had been founded on the assumption that new traffic generated by new or improved roads was negligible. UK traffic forecasts published in 1989 suggested that demand would soon outstrip supply in many key parts of the UK road system. The UK Secretary of State for Transport set up SACTRA (Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment) in order to review the way road traffic was forecast in the UK. The SACTRA report was published in December 1994, along with the UK government's response accepting that generated traffic should be taken into account in road scheme appraisal forthwith. This issue contains papers by SACTRA members and professionals who contributed evidence to the committee. Seven papers are presented.

AB  - The West Midlands Conurbation lies at the heart of the national motorway network with the main arteries of the M5 and M6 running through densely populated areas. In the early 1980's it became apparent that the urban sections of M5 and M6 required urgent relief. The policy of providing an orbital road to full motorway standards around the West Midlands conurbation was initiated in 1987 with the publication of the draft orders for the Birmingham Northern Relief Road (BNRR). Together with the existing M42 this will provide connections between the M5 and M6 around the southern and eastern sides of the conurbation. The final stage of this policy is the upgrading to motorway standards of previously programmed improvements in the A449 corridor on the western side of the conurbation. The Western Orbital Route is the largest single road project in the current road programme. This paper briefly describes the current proposals and some of the investigations carried out.

AB  - Transport planning is based on traffic forecasts which are subject to great uncertainties. These uncertainties have generally been ignored or, at least, not explicitly included in the planning process. This paper describes the principles behind the estimation of the uncertainty (or range of error) of the forecasts of a traffic model and discusses the means by which this information can be absorbed into the decision-making in transport planning projects. These principles have been applied to the appraisal of a British highway project and throughout the paper reference is made to this project in order to illustrate the results of the practical application of an explicit treatment of uncertainty. It is believed that this approach can and should be developed for application in most areas of transport planning, leading inevitably to an improvement in the quality of the decisions taken. © 1980 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Trip matrices incorporating traffic growth may give hourly traffic forecasts which exceed network capacity and are therefore unrealistic. Such matrices may be treated as initial estimates of traffic demand and they may be "capped' by constraining individual inter-zonal movements with ME2 to reflect the capacity of the routes they use. GMTU's matrix capping procedure does this automatically, processing overloaded inbound external links first and then capping the matrix on overloaded internal links, selected using thresholds. Two or three rounds of matrix capping and assignment/simulation are usually sufficient: the process is strongly convergent and results in assignments with realistic modelled link volumes, queuing and journey speeds. Overall, matrix capping is a powerful technique for matching the traffic in a forecast-year trip matrix with network capacity. -from Author

AB  - A study was undertaken to develop a methodology to estimate annual average daily traffic (AADT) for nonstate roads in urbanized areas in Florida. The current practice related to the estimation of AADT for non-state roads has been of great concern to the Florida Department of Transportation because of the potential lack of accuracy in the estimated data. For this study, a multiple regression model was developed for estimating AADT on nonstate roads. The model utilized a large sample size (data from 450 count stations in Broward County) and involved the investigation of up to 12 initial variables. Various methods, including geographic information systems (GIS), were explored to convert the current digital data and aggregate them into suitable forms for statistical analysis. Statistical tests were performed and the results showed that the most important contributing predictors are roadway characteristics, such as the number of lanes, functional classification, and area type. Socioeconomic variables, including population, dwelling units, automobile ownership, employment numbers, and school enrollment in the surrounding area, have an insignificant impact on AADT. Further analyses revealed the deficiency of traditional roadway functional classification, the need to improve the method of road classification, and the need for alternative methods to account for the impact of economic activities on AADT.

AB  - Traffic forecasting is used for circuit dimensioning and income prediction. Traffic forecasting in Japan has been carried out mainly by multiple regression models. However, recently, a traffic forecasting method using the Kalman filter for a state space model was proposed by David and Pack. When such a forecasting method is used, it is necessary to cope with outliers caused by various factors, such as social and/or economic factors, and observation errors. In this paper, because outliers correspond to the outliers of noises in the state space model, an algorithm for detecting and discriminating outliers by considering the noise distributions is developed. A new traffic forecasting method with a state space model including this algorithm is proposed. This method detects and discriminates changes in traffic patterns, and applies the necessary dispositions. The validity of this method is confirmed by applying it to field data.

AB  - A method is proposed for deriving a traffic characteristics model that can be used to forecast the traffic volume for intelligent telecommunication services. A sort of regression analysis with dummy variables is used to represent the service quantitatively and to construct the traffic characteristics model. Recursive least squares estimation, which is a special case of the Kaiman filter, is applied to the traffic characteristics model to forecast the traffic volume. In the proposed modeling and forecasting, qualitative factors representing a certain service attribute are selected and using an information criterion, the model with the best fit is identified as the most suitable forecasting model. Numerical results using practical observation data showed that the proposed method produces an accurate forecast and is thus effective for practical use.

AB  - This paper outlines a technique for constraining an initial (demand) trip matrix to reflect network capacity. The technique, known as 'matrix capping', uses the SATURN traffic model and SATURN's ME2 procedure. The matrix capping technique was developed and tested on the Greater ManchesterTransportation Unit's SATURN model for Trafford Park. The use of ME2 in forecasting is novel, and it contrasts with the usual application of ME2 in validation. The paper outlines the development of the matrix capping technique, describes the program which automates the procedure and presents test results. It also suggests applications for matrix capping, and outlines the implications of the technique for evaluation.

Reasons for the successful use of computers for national and intercontinental network planning and future circuit demands are examined. The share of the Federal Republic of Germany in the intercontinental traffic is described by means of concise tables on the traffic forecasts made by the meeting of the World Plan Committee, Venice, 1971, and the International Satellite Consortium, INTELSAT. Reasons why the original classification of the international transit exchanges into CT1, CT2 and CT3 was abandoned in Venice are discussed, along with the problem of the maximum channel capacity of a future communications satellite.

AB  - In view of increasing personnel costs and the greater complexity of the tasks involved in shortwave reception, computer-aided operation is becoming more and more prevalent, even in smaller stations. The preparation of band-occupancy statistics, the checking of propagation conditions, the continuous monitoring of certain calling frequencies, the changing of frequency in line with radio-traffic forecasts, the automatic setting up of communication links are only a few examples. Its technical concept and multipurpose remote-control facilties make the VLF-HF receiver EK 070 suitable for practically all applications in the frequency band 10 kHz to 30 MHz.

AB  - An investigation was made as to how short-term traffic forecasting on motorways and other trunk roads is related to the density of detectors. Forecasting performances with respect to different detector spaces have been investigated with both simulated data and real data. Pruning techniques to the input variables used for neural networks were applied to the simulated data. The real data were collected from the M25 motorway and included flow, speed, and occupancy. With the data used in our study, the forecasting performances decrease with the increase of detector spaces. However, by taking the assumed costs of detector infrastructure into account, it may be concluded from this study that increasing coverage to a spacing of 500 m gives little extra benefit and may actually be counter productive in certain circumstances. It was concluded that, on the basis of current evidence, a detector spacing of between 1 and 1.5 km might be optimal.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine briefly the amount of traffic which air controllers can manage with varying levels of automation. It is shown that automated aids to the controller expand his capacity to handle traffic by a factor of 2–3. The use of area navigation and rerouting can increase his traffic handling capacity by another factor of 2–3. Application of both techniques will be necessary eventually to control the traffic forecasted for the 1990's. The contents of this paper are based in part upon a study performed for the DOTATC Advisory Committee entitled “New York airspace loading and configuration” [1].

AB  - Traffic volume is one of the fundamental types of data that have been used for the traffic control and planning process. Forecasting needs and efforts for various applications will be increased with the deployment of advanced traffic management systems. With the importance of the short-term traffic forecasting task, numerous techniques have been utilized to improve its accuracy. The use of the subset autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for short-term traffic volume forecasting is investigated. A typical time-series modeling procedure was employed for this study. Model identification was carried out with Akaike's information criterion. The conditional maximum likelihood method was used for the parameter estimation process. Two white noise tests were applied for model verification. From the analysis results, four time-series models in different categories were identified and used for the one-step-ahead forecasting task. The performance of each model was evaluated using two statistical error estimates. Results showed that all time-series models performed well with reasonable accuracy. However, it was observed that the subset ARIMA model gave more stable and accurate results than other time-series models, especially a full ARIMA model. It is believed that the use of a subset ARIMA model could increase the accuracy of the short-term forecasting task within time-series models.

AB  - The Department of Transport's car ownership forecasts play an extremely influential role in shaping Britain's transport system. They are the principal determinant of the national traffic forecasts which in turn form the principal plank in the Department's case for building more roads. The arguments for aiding and abetting the growth of car ownership are morally and politically seductive, but they lead to a dirty, dangerous, socially-polarised, fume-filled greenhouse. -Author

AB  - Fast processors offer exciting opportunities for real-time traffic monitoring. Conventional transportation planning models that assume stable and predictable travel patterns do not lend themselves to on-line traffic forecasting. This paper describes how a new traffic flow inference model has the potential to determine comprehensive flow information in real time. Its philosophical basis is borrowed from the field of operational research, where it has been used for optimizing water and electricity flows. This paper shows how road traffic turning movement flows can be estimated from link detected flows at small recurrent intervals, in real time. The paper details the formulation of the problem, outlines the structure of the data set that provides the detector data for the model input and observed turning flows for the model evaluation. The theoretical principles that define the model are described briefly. Turning movement flow estimates, at 5-min intervals, from two independent surveys are presented and analyzed. The results show an overall mean coefficient of determination (r2) of 79-82% between observed and modeled turning movement flows.

AB  - Telecommunication network planning involves complex and interrelated tasks that range from demand and traffic forecasting to resource dimensioning and cost optimization of network structures. Large volumes of data and complex calculations make these tasks very time consuming, error-prone and expensive when performed by hand. The solution is to apply computers, and the corresponding discipline of computer-aided network planning (CANP) was born in the 1970s with availability of computers powerful and fast enough for the job. The National Telecommunications Research Center (CNET) in France was a pioneer in CANP, developed to efficiently control the very fast growth and evolution of the country's public telecommunications system. This article describes the main tasks in network planning and then briefly presents the main CANP programs developed by the CNET for their automation and optimization. These programs are (or, in a few cases, will soon be) employed by French Telecommunications, the Transpac company, major French companies and public agencies, and several foreign network providers.

AB  - In a recent contribution to this journal, Adams expounded upon the unrealistic and dangerous nature of the car ownership forecasts contained in the National Road Traffic Forecasts (Great Britain) 1989 (NRTF) and used by the Department of Transport in its planning decisions. Adams suggested that should the forecasts prove anywhere near correct, Britain would be a disgusting, smelly and dangerous place in which to live. In spelling out the practical implications of the forecasts, he implied that the forecasts were implausible because of the problems their realisation would cause. But what about the NTRF freight traffic forecasts? What are the implications of the freight forecasts and are these equally implausible? The aim of this article is to shed some light on this question. -from Author

AB  - In the U.K., the Department of Transport (DOT) has issued National Road Traffic Forecasts (NRTF) for use as the basis of future traffic flow forecasting. It is, however, not certain whether the longer-term travel demands predicted by these forecasts can be met by the capacity of future road networks, particularly in urban areas. When the demand rises to levels at which the quality of service on the road network becomes unacceptable, drivers may have to choose between suppressing their journey, changing their mode of transport or diverting their trip to another time period. In an attempt to try and incorporate these decisions in modem-day traffic modelling, planners have developed various techniques to simulate drivers' decisions either to suppress, to change or to divert their trips. This paper describes three of these methods which have been proposed in response to the need to use demand forecasts in highway evaluation while accepting that the road system may not be able to satisfy this demand. The methods described are: - shadow networks; - matrix capping; and - elastic assignment.

AB  - A hybrid method of short-term traffic forecasting is introduced; the KARIMA method. The technique uses a Kohonen self-organizing map as an initial classifier; each class has an individually tuned ARIMA model associated with it. Using a Kohonen map which is hexagonal in layout eases the problem of defining the classes. The explicit separation of the tasks of classification and functional approximation greatly improves forecasting performance compared to either a single ARIMA model or a backpropagation neural network. The model is demonstrated by producing forecasts of traffic flow, at horizons of half an hour and an hour, for a French motorway. Performance is similar to that exhibited by other layered models, but the number of classes needed is much smaller (typically between two and four). Because the number of classes is small, it is concluded that the algorithm could be easily retrained in order to track long-term changes in traffic flow and should also prove to be readily transferrable.

AB  - Peak spreading is the tendency for travellers to change the time they make their journeys as travel conditions deteriorate. In particular, there is a tendency for the peak-period profile of journeys to become wider and flatter as the number of travellers increases and congestion increases. The superficial impression is that this is deliberate behaviour, people are deciding to leave home earlier to go to work. Therefore many observers assume that they do this so they can avoid the worsening peak-period travel conditions. The question to be addressed is what effect travel retiming has on forecasts of traffic in peak and shoulder periods and on the calculation of the benefit of urban road improvements; and, if the error in the benefit as calculated by conventional methods were significant, what practical methods might be used to obtain better estimates. This paper reviews a programme of research into peak spreading carried out at the Transport and Road Research Laboratory. There were three main stages: The development of a simple mathematical model of the morning peak based on simple but reasonable assumptions about the adaptive behaviour of travellers. A stated preference survey of the behaviour of morning peak-period travellers by car into central London. The development of a macro model of traveller adaptation based on utility maximisation. -from Author

AB  - Microcomputers and associated software are providing tremendous opportunities for the public works engineer in the analysis and evaluation of transportation projects. In particular, a wealth of software is available for evaluating urban arterial improvements in both the long term and the short term, and in establishing project priorities. Microcomputer software exists for rojectlevel traffic forecasting, traffic operations project analysis, and the prioritization of projects. For project-level traffic forecasting, a microcomputer package, simplified project forecasting (SPF), provides a cost-effective procedure for determining future traffic estimates on urban arterials. Several packages exist for traffic operations project analysis. These include: signal operation analysis package (SOAP-84); progression analysis and signal system evaluation routine (PASSER); highway capacity manual—signalized and unsignalized intersections; and queue work zone (QUEWZ) impacts. The needs inventory system (NIS) provides a useful package for identifying deficient arterials and prioritizing candidate improvement projects. These packages greatly enhance the ability of the public works engineer to evaluate urban arterial projects. © ASCE.

AB  - Freeway traffic flow forecasting will play an important role in intelligent transportation systems. The TRB Committee on Freeway Operations has included freeway flow forecasting in its 1995 research program. Much of the past research in traffic flow forecasting has addressed short-term, single-interval predictions. Such limited forecasting models will not support the development of the longer-term operational strategies needed for such events as hazardous material incidents. A multiple-interval freeway traffic flow forecasting model has been developed that predicts traffic volumes in 15-min intervals for several hours into the future. The nonparametric regression modeling technique was chosen for the multiple-interval freeway traffic flow forecasting problem. The technique possesses a number of attractive qualities for traffic forecasting. It is intuitive and uses a data base of past conditions to generate forecasts. It can also be implemented as a generic algorithm and is easily calibrated at field locations, suiting it for wide-scale deployment. The model was applied at two sites on the Capital Beltway monitored by the Northern Virginia Traffic Management System. The nonparametric regression forecasting model produced accurate short- and long-term volume estimates at both sites.

AB  - The traditional road-scheme appraisal modeling techniques have ignored the potential responses by travelers to the changing congestion levels. A number of different approaches have been developed over the past few years to incorporate growth forecasting into the traffic modeling framework. Most of these have been associated with incorporating the growth constraints within the trip assignment phase of the modeling. The UK's Dept. of Transport has initiated a program to assess and compare the main features of each approach by applying them to actual or proposed road schemes in different urban and peri-urban contexts. The program aims to study the effects on travel patterns and traffic conditions arising from the choice of modeling approach.

AB  - Operational decision-making means controlling passenger demand, and allocating aircraft and other resources to work implied by demand. Accurate forecasting is then needed for making proper trade-offs between spoilage and rejects. Efforts towards implementing optimization systems for airline operational problems have been in process for some twenty years. Departure overbooking was one of the first successful implementations in Scandinavian Airlines. Several attempts to use traffic forecasts in operational resource planning systems have been successful. One key issue has been the need to quantify the airline strategy when optimizing in a functional planning situation. Several application examples are given.

AB  - The U.S. Congress mandated the development of six transportation management systems with the passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Each of these management systems provides transportation planners with an inventory of transportation facilities and associated performance data that can be used to relate the performance of the facility. Toward the end of achieving better transportation planning, the management systems can be further integrated to yield a powerful transportation planning tool that can be used to analyze and quantify the pavement needs of intermodal facilities. Pavement designers can use this tool for traffic forecasting to allow more representative pavement designs. Transportation planners can also use this tool to predict the results of changes in shipping practices before they occur. The described procedure greatly enhances the transportation planning process by allowing the process to be more proactive rather than reactive. Modal shifts in freight traffic can result in significantly increased highway maintenance costs. These shifts can be induced by changes in the regulatory or fiscal policies governing transportation or by physical changes in the transportation infrastructure. As an example, the abandonment of a set of branch lines is analyzed to determine the increased highway maintenance costs that would result if all shipments currently carried by rail along the branch lines were diverted to truck transportation. A background of the transportation management systems and their application to transportation planning is provided.

AB  - The article defines the new service and outlines the prerequistes for its introduction in West Germany. In veiw of the special features of the Teletex terminal, the capacity of development of the future Teletex service is emphasized. The facilities of the new service are described under the aspect of international compatibility. This includes interworking with the Telex service and possibly with other text communication services. The influence of Teletex on the existing Telex and Telefax services is treated briefly. In this connection, traffic forecasts and a partial substitution for the letter mail show the increasing importance of the Teletex service. A comparison of the transmission costs in the latter mail service with those incurred by the communication in the Teletex service gives information on the cost advantages as a function of the traffic volume.

AB  - The recent worldwide tendency towards the introduction of commercially and privately provided roads proves to be efficient for building and operating road systems. One of the important issues concerning development of a private toll road is the selection of its capacity and toll charge and the evaluation of the relevant benefits to the private investor, the road users and the whole society. Yang and Meng [Transportation Research 34A (2000)] have recently examined this critical issue in a road network context. An important limitation in their analysis is that a single (average) value of time (VOT) for all road users is assumed in the network equilibrium model for traffic forecasts. It is a fact that each user has a different VOT, depending on how much money or time he or she is willing or able to spend on a particular trip. This paper relaxes the earlier single VOT assumption using multi-class network equilibrium model. The entire population of users is segmented into a number of groups or classes according to their VOT, and trip rates by different groups are characterized by distinct group-specific demand functions. Users are assumed to minimize their individual generalized trip cost, and thus divide themselves among the various alternative routes that are differentiated on the basis of travel time and monetary cost. With the explicit consideration of user heterogeneity, we investigate the various possibilities of profitability and welfare gain of a private toll road in a given network under various combinations of road capacity and toll charge. In particular, we compare and contrast the outcomes with the case of a single average VOT, and investigate how VOT distribution affects traffic flow and profit forecasts of private toll roads. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Freeway traffic flow forecasting will play an important role in intelligent transportation systems. The TRB Committee on Freeway Operations has included freeway flow forecasting in its 1995 research program. Much of the past research in traffic flow forecasting has addressed short-term, single-interval predictions. Such limited forecasting models will not support the development of the longer-term operational strategies needed for such events as hazardous material incidents. A multiple-interval freeway traffic flow forecasting model has been developed that predicts traffic volumes in 15-min intervals for several hours into the future. The nonparametric regression modeling technique was chosen for the multiple-interval freeway traffic flow forecasting problem. The technique possesses a number of attractive qualities for traffic forecasting. It is intuitive and uses a data base of past conditions to generate forecasts. It can also be implemented as a generic algorithm and is easily calibrated at field locations, suiting it for wide-scale deployment. The model was applied at two sites on the Capital Beltway monitored by the Northern Virginia Traffic Management System. The nonparametric regression forecasting model produced accurate short- and long-term volume estimates at both sites.

The rapid growth of air traffic forecast for the balance of the century and the great strides being achieved in technology make it appropriate to commence development of such a system at this time. The design of such a system must be constrained by a number of technical and economic factors. Among these are an economically feasible implementation plan, a selection of spectrum, a high degree of operational flexibility and a broad capability of functional performance. 1971 Institute of Navigation

AB  - Traffic forecasts were prepared by the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) for a proposed high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in northeastern Illinois as part of a Stevenson Expressway HOV lane feasibility study. The traffic assignment procedure developed for this project is outlined. Problems encountered in adapting traffic assignment to highway networks with HOV lanes are first presented. Then, network equilibrium concepts are used to illustrate driver behavior when an HOV lane is available. It is concluded that an equilibrium traffic assignment procedure may be applied to HOV lane traffic assignment. Remaining sections of the paper deal with particular issues in applying the HOV lane traffic assignment in the Stevenson Expressway project. Coding of different HOV lane alternatives in CATS traffic assignment network is discussed and network coding for a concurrent HOV lane illustrated. Trip tables are adjusted for altered mode and vehicle occupancy choices caused by the time savings between the HOV lane and general purpose expressway lanes. The HOV lane traffic assignments were accomplished with software from the Urban Transportation Planning System. The resulting HOV lane traffic assignment procedure is only slightly more complex than normal equilibrium traffic assignment. Results from one of the project's HOV lane traffic assignments are reported in the final section.

AB  - Video-On-Demand (VOD) service will cover a large region to provide an interactive multimedia service. As a service provider, the storage and transmission cost is a dominant factor to maximize the profit. The storage cost depends on the number of copies of a video program stored as well as the storage locations in the VOD network. Once the video is placed on the network, the routing strategy affects the transmission cost significantly when the traffic pattern is different from the traffic forecast in the network planning stage. In this paper, we propose both video placement and dynamic routing algorithms used in VOD network. From the simulation results, it can be seen that the video placement algorithm is efficient to obtain a near-optimal placement solution and the dynamic routing reduces the transmission cost by adapting the changes in traffic demand.

AB  - In this paper, we model a packet multiplexer for continuous bit rate (CBR) traffic in an ATM network as an nD/D/1 queue. We compare the efficiency of various algorithms for finding the delay distribution. In particular, we propose a new algorithm whose time complexity is O(n2) where n is the number of voice sources being multiplexed. Further, the use of the central limit theorem can reduce the time complexity to O(n) for large n. We find an asymptotic formula whose time complexity is independent of n and it works well (for practical purposes) over a wide range of parameter values. We examine and comment on the use of the M/D/1 results as an approximation. In addition to comparing the performance of these algorithms, we show that the buffer requirements for such a queue is significantly less than the theoretical maximum (even when the requirement on the call disruption probability is very low). This result has important implications in the design of buffer size. Further the buffer requirement is relatively insensitive to the design criterion (call disruption probability) so that inaccuracies in measurements and/or traffic forecasts will not lead to erroneous design. © 1991 IEEE

AB  - A key component of the daily operation and planning activities of a traffic control centre is short-term forecasting, i.e. the prediction of daily to the next few days of traffic flow. Such forecasts have a significant impact on the optimal regulation of the road traffic on all kinds of freeways. They are increasingly important in an environment with increasing road traffic problems. The present paper aims at presenting the effectiveness of a neural network system for prediction based on time-series data. We only use one parameter, namely traffic volume for the forecasting. We employ artificial neural networks for traffic forecasting applied on a road section. Recurrent Jordan networks, popular in the modelling of time series, is examined in this study. Simulation results demonstrate that learning with this type of architecture has a good generalisation ability.

AB  - A review of methods for dynamic traffic forecasting which have recently been developed by DaimlerChrysler AG is presented. In particular, some new models for tracing and forecasting of congested spatial-temporal patterns on highways will be considered. These models ASDA (Automatische Staudynamikanalyse: Automatic Tracing of Moving Traffic Jams) and FOTO (Forecasting Of Traffic Objects) allow us to trace and to predict macroscopic spatial-temporal properties of the traffic patterns without any validation of model parameters at different infrastructure, weather and other environmental conditions. Results of the on-line application of these models are shortly discussed. A macroscopic model for dynamic forecast of traffic in urban areas is presented. This model allows us to predict macroscopic characteristics of traffic such as queue lengths at light signals and link travel times. The calculation time of the model can be several thousand times shorter than the one of microscopic traffic models. © Oldenbourg Verlag.

AB  - In 1988 Britain spent £77.8 billion on transport. Of that vast expenditure £74.9 billion - 96 per cent - was spent on transport by road. Some 93 per cent of land borne passenger traffic and 87 per cent of freight traffic travels on the road system. These figures vividly illustrate our dependence on roads for the movement of people and for the delivery of goods and services. In Britain there are 216,000 miles of roads. Of these 206,000 miles are the responsibility of local highway authorities. These roads vary from residential streets to important regional traffic arteries. The remaining 10,000 miles - roughly 5 per cent of the road network - is the national trunk road system and is the direct responsibility of Central Government. This study analyzes the traffic congestion and its costs as well as the traffic forecasts and trunk road investment program.

AB  - The bridge, which inter-connects the two main areas (residential and commercial) of Hobart, has an overall length of 976 m and consists of two continuous prestressed concrete box-section parallel girders, covering 10 spans. The 8 central spans are 109 m long, providing 93 m wide and 15,20 m high navigable space. The total constant deck width is 21,40 m and was erected using the successive segment method. The first five segments of each span were glued and stressed together, with prestressing carried out at the plant. The rectangular-section piers are 12 m in height and bear upon different types of foundations.

AB  - The Ministry of Equipment, Vocational Training and Middle Management Training, in liaison with all the bodies involved in port activity, embarked on the study of a National Ports Plan, laying down guidelines for the definition of infrastructural needs and a timetable for the execution of works so as to enable Moroccan ports to handle in the best possible conditions the levels of traffic forecast for the horizons 1985, 1990 and 2000. One aspect of the plan is gradual transfer of the high seas fleet from Las Palmas, to Morocco ports, especially Agadir and Tan-Tan. A brief description of all the Moroccan ports, is presented and illustrated with detailed port plans. Apart from the two ports mentioned, the following ports are described. Safi, Essaouira, Casablanca, Tangier, Larache, Hoceima, Nador, M'Diq, Mehdia, Asilah, Tarfaya, Sidi Ifni, Laayoune, Ras Kebdana, El Jadida, and Jebha.

AB  - This paper proposes a capacity-constrained traffic assignment model for strategic transport planning in which the steady-state user equilibrium principle is extended for road networks with residual queues. Therefore, the road-exit capacity and the queuing effects can be incorporated into the strategic transport model for traffic forecasting. The proposed model is applicable to the congested network particularly when the traffic demands exceed the capacity of the network during the peak period. An efficient solution method is proposed for solving the steady-state traffic assignment problem with residual queues. Then a simple numerical example is employed to demonstrate the application of the proposed model and solution method, while an example of a medium-sized arterial highway network in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is used to test the applicability of the proposed solution to real problems.

AB  - Three problems are discussed which affect the interpretation and feasibility of the Government's transport plan for 2000-2010. First, it is argued that the cost of funds, and technical feasibility of scheduling an investment programme, causes serious difficulties for implementation of rail infrastructure improvements. A suggestion is made that Railtrack might be restructured with trust status, this being preferable to either the status quo or renationalisation. Secondly, some unresolved inconsistencies in the plan for reducing congestion are discussed, especially the forecasts that substantial reductions in congestion will be achieved at the same time as substantial increases in traffic volumes. It is suggested that the measure of congestion used exaggerates the extremely small expected changes in traffic speed. Thirdly, it is noted that the fuel price protests of 2000, and the traffic forecasts for 2010, are both marked by a possible underestimate of the sensitivity of fuel price as an influence on behaviour and on political attitudes. The paper expresses some concern about a possible loss in clarity and underlying consistency in the long term strategy for transport, reducing the consensus built up by previous Conservative and Labour administrations.

AB  - There is a growing need for quantitative traffic-estimating tools to improve pedestrian transportation safety, access, and mobility. A sketch-plan method is introduced to estimate peak-hour pedestrian trips for crossings at intersections (node) and parallel sidewalk-midblock (link) locations. This tool integrates pedestrian travel into routine trip-estimating by applying standard traffic data to quantify pedestrian trips. The method presented is based on access-egress mode trip generation and applies peak vehicle-per-hour turning movements, transit vehicle or passenger counts, and walk and bike counts or projections to produce total peak pedestrian-per-hour (pph) trips. A previous method used trip rates based on land use to generate pph trips. However, that model is 20 years old, requires detailed land use data, and does not distribute and assign pedestrian trips. The following sketch-plan method was developed in a case-study of a suburban growth corridor in Plattsburgh, New York. Sample applications of pedestrian trip-generation estimates are presented to illustrate how pedestrian travel-demand projections, in addition to vehicular traffic forecasting, can support the adoption of balanced facility treatments to meet the mobility and safety needs of all modes of transportation.

AB  - Faith in the future of high-speed trains in the U. S. is not universal; but as candidate corridors multiply, manufacturers are running hard to capture what could be a big new market. The answer is demand - demand stemming from problems besetting those very air and highway competitors that virtually cleared passenger trains from main lines. So far, that demand is more anticipated than actual. But the anticipation is rooted in hard-nosed traffic forecasts, and it has caused local governments and potential investors from the business community to give serious consideration to importing technologies new to the U. S. - technologies that allow passenger trains to run from 125 mph to 250 mph.

AB  - Accurate air interface traffic forecasting and dimensioning is of importance in any cellular network for achieving cost and quality requirements. A previous paper analyzed the appropriateness of the Erlang B model to estimate the mean call blocking experienced by cellular traffic using the traditional confidence interval method. This paper presents a modified confidence interval method to compare the mean blocking of the measured data and Erlang B results. In addition to a more complete study of the mean, the blocking distribution is also considered. The Erlang Loss Model (ELM) is studied to completely characterize the distribution of blocking using the ELM. Exact expressions for the busy time distribution are derived for this study. The results presented in this paper indicate that Erlang B formula is an appropriate model for calculating mean call blocking on the air interface. The ELM on the other hand appears to be rather a poor model for the overall blocking distribution. Further study is needed to establish the appropriateness of Erlang B formula as a general tool.
